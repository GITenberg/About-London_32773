NEWSPAPER PEOPLE.</h2>
<p>What would the Englishman do without his newspaper I cannot
imagine.&nbsp; The sun might just as well refuse to shine, as the
press refuse to turn out its myriads of newspapers.&nbsp;
Conversation would cease at once.&nbsp; Brown, with his morning
paper in his hand, has very decided opinions indeed,&mdash;can
tell you what the French Emperor is about,&mdash;what the Pope
will be compelled to do,&mdash;what is the aim of
Sardinia,&mdash;and what is Austria&rsquo;s little game.&nbsp; I
dined at Jenkins&rsquo;s yesterday, and for three hours over the
wine I was compelled to listen to what I had read in that
morning&rsquo;s <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; The worst of it was, that
when I joined the ladies I was no better off, as the dear
creatures were full of the particulars of the grand Rifle
Ball.&nbsp; When I travel by the rail, I am gratified with
details of divorce cases&mdash;of terrible accidents&mdash;of
dreadful shipwrecks&mdash;of atrocious murders&mdash;<!-- page
2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>of
ingenious swindling, all brought to light by means of the
press.&nbsp; What people could have found to talk about before
the invention of newspapers, is beyond my limited
comprehension.&nbsp; They must have been a dull set in those dark
days; I suppose the farmers and country gentlemen talked of
bullocks, and tradespeople about trade; the ladies about
fashions, and cookery, and the plague of bad servants.&nbsp; We
are wonderfully smarter now, and shine, though it be with a
borrowed light.</p>
<p>A daily newspaper is, to a man of my way of thinking, one of
the most wonderful phenomena of these latter days.&nbsp; It is a
crown of glory to our land.&nbsp; It is true, in some quarters, a
contrary opinion is held.&nbsp; &ldquo;The press,&rdquo; Mr.
David Urquhart very seriously tells us, &ldquo;is an invention
for the development of original sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the opinion
of that amiable cynic, the late Mr. Henry Drummond, a newspaper
is but a medium for the circulation of gossip; but, in spite of
individuals, the general fact remains that the press is not
merely a wonderful organization, but an enormous power in any
land&mdash;in ours most of all, where public opinion rules more
or less directly.&nbsp; Our army in the Crimea was saved by the
<i>Times</i>.&nbsp; When the <i>Times</i> turned, free-trade was
carried.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> not long since made a panic, and
securities became in some cases utterly unsaleable, and some
seventy stockbrokers were ruined.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> says we
don&rsquo;t want a Reform Bill, and Lord John can scarce drag his
measure through the Commons.&nbsp; But it is not of the power,
but of the organization of the press I would speak.&nbsp;
According <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>to geologists, ages passed away before
this earth of ours became fit for human habitation; volcanic
agencies were previously to be in action&mdash;plants and
animals, that exist not now, were to be born, and live, and
die&mdash;tropical climates were to become temperate, and oceans,
solid land.&nbsp; In a similar way, the newspaper is the result
of agencies and antecedents almost equally wondrous and
remote.&nbsp; For ages have science, and nature, and man been
preparing its way.&nbsp; Society had to become
intellectual&mdash;letters had to be invented&mdash;types had to
be formed&mdash;paper had to be substituted for papyrus&mdash;the
printing-press had to become wedded to steam&mdash;the
electric-telegraph had to be discovered, and the problem of
liberty had to be solved, in a manner more or less satisfactory,
before a newspaper, as we understand the word, could be; and that
we have the fruit of all this laid on our breakfast-table every
morning, for at the most five-pence, and at the least one-penny,
is wonderful indeed.&nbsp; But, instead of dwelling on manifest
truisms, let us think awhile of a newspaper-office, and those who
do business there.&nbsp; Externally, there is nothing remarkable
in a newspaper-office.&nbsp; You pass by at night, and see many
windows lighted with gas, that is all.&nbsp; By daylight there is
nothing to attract curiosity, indeed, in the early part of the
day, there is little going on at a newspaper-office.&nbsp; When
you and I are hard at work, newspaper people are enjoying their
night; when you and I are asleep, they are hard at work for
us.&nbsp; They have a hot-house appearance, and are rarely
octogenarians.&nbsp; <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The conscientious editor of a daily
newspaper can never be free from anxiety.&nbsp; He has enough to
do to keep all to their post; he must see that the leader-writers
are all up to the mark&mdash;that the reporters do their
duty&mdash;that the literary critic, and the theatrical critic,
and the musical critic, and the city correspondent, and the
special reporter, and the host of nameless contributors, do not
disappoint or deceive the public, and that every day the daily
sheet shall have something in it to excite, or inform, or
improve.&nbsp; But while you and I are standing outside, the
editor, in some remote suburb, is, it may be, dreaming of
pleasanter things than politics and papers.&nbsp; One man,
however, is on the premises, and that is the manager.&nbsp; He
represents the proprietors, and is, in his sphere, as great a man
as the editor.&nbsp; It is well to be deferential to the
manager.&nbsp; He is a wonder in his way,&mdash;literary man, yet
man of business.&nbsp; He must know everybody, be able at a
moment&rsquo;s notice to pick the right man out, and send him, it
may be, to the Antipodes.&nbsp; Of all events that are to come
off in the course of the year, unexpected or the reverse, he must
have a clear and distinct perception, that he may have
eye-witnesses there for the benefit of the British public.&nbsp;
He, too, must contrive, so that out-goings shall not exceed
receipts, and that the paper pays.&nbsp; He must be active,
wide-awake, possessed of considerable tact, and if, when an Irish
gentleman, with a big stick, calls and asks to see the editor or
manager, he knows how to knock a man down, so much the
better.&nbsp; Of course, managers are not required for the
smaller <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>weeklies.&nbsp; In some of the offices
there is very little subdivision of labour.&nbsp; The editor
writes the leaders and reviews, and the sub-editor does the
paste-and-scissors work.&nbsp; But let us return to the daily
paper;&mdash;outside of the office of which we have been so rude
as to leave the reader standing all this while.</p>
<p>At present there is no sign of life.&nbsp; It is true, already
the postman has delivered innumerable letters from all quarters
of the globe&mdash;that the electric telegraph has sent its
messages&mdash;that the railways have brought their
despatches&mdash;that the publishers have furnished books of all
sorts and sizes for review&mdash;and that tickets from all the
London exhibitions are soliciting a friendly notice.&nbsp; There
let them lie unheeded, till the coming man appears.&nbsp; Even
the publisher, who was here at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
has gone home: only a few clerks, connected with the financial
department of the paper, or to receive advertisements, are on the
spot.&nbsp; We may suppose that somewhere between one and two the
first editorial visit will be paid, and that then this chaos is
reduced to order; and that the ideas, which are to be represented
in the paper of to-morrow, are discussed, and the daily organs
received, and gossip of all sorts from the clubs&mdash;from the
house&mdash;from the city&mdash;collected and condensed; a little
later perhaps assistants arrive&mdash;one to cull all the sweets
from the provincial journals&mdash;another to look over the files
of foreign papers&mdash;another it may be to translate important
documents.&nbsp; The great machine is now getting steadily at
work.&nbsp; Up in the <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>composing-room are printers already
fingering their types.</p>
<p>In the law-courts, a briefless barrister is taking
notes&mdash;in the police-courts, reporters are at work, and far
away in the city, &ldquo;our city correspondent&rdquo; is
collecting the commercial news of the hour&mdash;and in all parts
of London penny-a-liners, like eagles scenting carrion, are
ferreting out for the particulars of the last
&ldquo;extraordinary elopement,&rdquo; or &ldquo;romantic
suicide.&rdquo;&nbsp; The later it grows the more gigantic
becomes the pressure.&nbsp; The parliamentary reporters are now
furnishing their quota; gentlemen who have been assisting at
public-dinners come redolent of post-prandial eloquence, which
has to be reduced to sense and grammar.&nbsp; It is now midnight,
and yet we have to wait the arrival of the close of the
parliamentary debate, on which the editor must write a leader
before he leaves; and the theatrical critic&rsquo;s verdict on
the new play.&nbsp; In the meanwhile the foreman of the printers
takes stock, being perfectly aware that he cannot perform the
wonderful feat of making a pint bottle hold a quart.&nbsp; Woe is
me! he has already half a dozen columns in excess.&nbsp; What is
to be done?&nbsp; Well, the literature must stand over,
that&rsquo;s very clear, then those translations from the French
will do to-morrow, and this report will also not hurt by
delay&mdash;as to the rest, that must be cut down and still
further condensed; but quickly, for time is passing, and we must
be on the machine at three.&nbsp; Quickly fly the
minutes&mdash;hotter becomes the gas-lit room&mdash;wearier the
editorial <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>staff.&nbsp; But the hours bring
relief.&nbsp; The principal editor has done his leader and
departed&mdash;the assistants have done the same&mdash;so have
the reporters, only the sub-editor remains, and as daylight is
glimmering in the east, and even fast London is asleep, he
quietly lights a cigar, and likewise departs; the printers will
follow as soon as the forms have gone down, and the movements
below indicate that the machine, by the aid of steam, is
printing.</p>
<p>We have thus seen most of the newspaper people off the
premises.&nbsp; As we go out into the open air, we may yet find a
few of them scorning an ignoble repose.&nbsp; For instance, there
is a penny-a-liner&mdash;literally he is not a penny-a-liner, as
he is generally paid three-farthings a line, and very good pay
that is, as the same account, written on very thin paper, called
flimsy, is left at all the newspaper-offices, which, if they all
insert, they all pay for, and one short tale may put the
penny-a-liner in funds for a week.&nbsp; The penny-a-liner has
long been the butt of a heartless world.&nbsp; He ought to be a
cynic, and I fear is but an indifferent Christian, and very so-so
as head of a family.&nbsp; His appearance is somewhat against
him, and his antecedents are eccentric; his face has a beery
appearance; his clothes are worn in defiance of fashion; neither
his hat nor his boots would be considered by a swell as the
correct stilton; you would scarce take him as the representative
of the potent fourth estate.&nbsp; Yet penny-a-liner&rsquo;s
rise; one of them is now the editor of a morning paper; another
is the <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>manager of a commercial establishment, with a salary of
almost a thousand a year; but chiefly, I imagine, they are jolly
good fellows going down the hill.&nbsp; Charles Lamb said he
never greatly cared for the society of what are called good
people.&nbsp; The penny-a-liners have a similar weakness; they
are true Bohemians, and are prone to hear the chimes at
midnight.&nbsp; Literally, they take no thought for to-morrow,
and occasionally are put to hard shifts.&nbsp; Hence it is
sub-editors have to be on their guard with their dealings with
them.&nbsp; Their powers of imagination and description are
great.&nbsp; They are prone to harrow up your souls with horrors
that never existed; and as they are paid by the line, a harsh
prosaic brevity is by no means their fault.&nbsp; Occasionally
they take in the papers.&nbsp; Not long since a most
extraordinary breach of promise case went the round of the
evening papers, which was entirely a fiction of the
penny-a-liners.&nbsp; Yet let us not think disparagingly of
them&mdash;of a daily newspaper no small part is the result of
their diligent research.&nbsp; And if they do occasionally
indulge in fiction, their fictions are generally founded on
fact.&nbsp; The reader, if he be a wise man, will smile and pass
on&mdash;a dull dog will take the matter seriously and make an
ass of himself.&nbsp; For instance, only this very year, there
was a serious controversy about Disraeli&rsquo;s literary
piracies, as they were called in the <i>Manchester
Examiner</i>.&nbsp; It appears a paragraph was inserted in an
obscure London journal giving an account of an evening party at
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s, at which Mr. Disraeli had been <!-- page
9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>present&mdash;an event just as probable as that the
Bishop of Oxford would take tea at Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Mr. Disraeli&rsquo;s remarks were reported, and the
paragraph&mdash;notwithstanding its glaring absurdity&mdash;was
quoted in the <i>Manchester Examiner</i>.&nbsp; Some acute reader
remembered to have read a similar conversation attributed to
Coleridge, and immediately wrote to the <i>Examiner</i> to that
effect.&nbsp; The letter was unhandsomely inserted with a bold
heading,&mdash;several letters were inserted on the same subject,
and hence, just because a poor penny-a-liner at his wits&rsquo;
end doctored up a little par, and attributed a very old
conversation to Mr. Disraeli, the latter is believed in
Cottonopolis guilty of a piracy, Cottonopolis being all the more
ready to believe this of Mr. Disraeli, as the latter gentleman is
at the head of a party not supposed to be particularly attached
to the doctrines of what are termed the Manchester School.&nbsp;
Really editors and correspondents should be up to these little
dodges, and not believe all they see in print.</p>
<p>I would also speak of another class of newspaper
people&mdash;the newspaper boy, agile as a lamp-lighter, sharp in
his glances as a cat.&nbsp; The newspaper boy is of all ages,
from twelve to forty, but they are all alike, very disorderly,
and very ardent politicians; and while they are waiting in the
publishing-office for their papers they are prone to indulge in
political gossip, after the manner of their betters at the
west-end clubs.&nbsp; On the trial of Bernard, the excitement
among the newspaper boys was <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>very
great.&nbsp; I heard some of them, on the last day of the trial,
confess to having been too excited all that day to do anything;
their admiration of the speech of Edwin James was intense.&nbsp;
A small enthusiast near me said to another, &ldquo;That ere James
is the fellow to work &rsquo;em; didn&rsquo;t he pitch hin to the
hemperor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a sadder and wiser boy; &ldquo;yes,
he&rsquo;s all werry well, but he&rsquo;d a spoke on
t&rsquo;other side just as well if he&rsquo;d been
paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; would he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s wot I call swindling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; They does their best.&nbsp;
Them as pays you, you works for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether the explanation was satisfactory I can&rsquo;t say, as
the small boy&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s name was called, and he
vanished with &ldquo;two quire&rdquo; on his youthful head.&nbsp;
But generally these small boys prefer wit to politics; they are
much given to practical jokes at each other&rsquo;s expense, and
have no mercy for individual peculiarities.&nbsp; Theirs is a
hard life, from five in the morning, when the daily papers
commence publishing, to seven in the evening, when the second
edition of the <i>Sun</i> with the <i>Gazette</i> appears.&nbsp;
What becomes of them when they cease to be newspaper boys, must
be left to conjecture.&nbsp; Surely such riotous youths can never
become tradesmen in a small way, retailers of greens, itinerant
dealers in coal.&nbsp; Do not offend these gentry if you are a
newspaper proprietor.&nbsp; Their power for mischief is
great.&nbsp; At the <i>Illustrated </i><!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span><i>News</i>
office I have seen a policeman required to reduce them to
order.</p>
<p>Finally, of all newspaper people, high or low, let me ask the
public to speak charitably.&nbsp; They are hard-worked, they are
not over-paid, and some of them die prematurely old.&nbsp; Ten
years of night-work in the office of a daily newspaper is enough
to kill any man, even if he has the constitution of a horse; one
can&rsquo;t get on without them; and it is a sad day for his
family when Paterfamilias misses his paper.&nbsp; Whigs, tories,
prelates, princes, valiant warriors, and great lawyers, are not
so essential to the daily weal of the public, as newspaper
people.&nbsp; In other ways they are useful&mdash;the great
British naturalist, Mr. Yarell, was a newspaper vendor.</p>

SPIRITUALISM.</h2>
<p>In the <i>Morning Star</i>, a few months since, appeared a
letter from William Howitt, intimating that if the religious
public wished to hear a man truly eloquent and religious, a
Christian and a genius, they could not do better than go and hear
the Rev. Mr. Harris.&nbsp; Accordingly, one Sunday in January, we
found ourselves part of a respectable congregation, chiefly
males, assembled to hear the gentleman aforesaid.&nbsp; The place
of meeting was the Music Hall, Store-street; the reverend
gentleman occupying the platform, and the audience filling up the
rest of the room.&nbsp; It is difficult to judge of numbers, but
there must have been four or five hundred persons present.&nbsp;
Mr. Harris evidently is an American, is, we should imagine,
between thirty and forty, and with his low black eye-brows, and
black beard, and sallow countenance, has not a very prepossessing
appearance.&nbsp; He had very much of the conventional idea of
the methodist parson.&nbsp; I do not by this imply that the
conventional idea is correct, but simply that we have such a
conventional idea, and that Mr. Harris answers to it.&nbsp; As I
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>have intimated that I believe Mr. Harris is an American,
I need not add that he is thin, and that his figure is of
moderate height.&nbsp; The subject on which he preached was the
axe being laid at the foot of the tree, and at considerable
length&mdash;the sermon lasted more than an hour&mdash;the
reverend gentleman endeavoured to show that men lived as God was
in them, and that we were not to judge from a few outward signs
that God was in them, and, as instances of men filled and
inspired by God&rsquo;s Spirit, we had our Saxon Alfred, Oliver
Cromwell, and Florence Nightingale.&nbsp; In the prayer and
sermon of the preacher there was very little to indicate that he
was preaching a new gospel.&nbsp; The principal thing about him
was his action, which, in some respects, resembled that of the
great American Temperance orator, Mr. Gough.&nbsp; Mr. Harris
endeavours as much as possible to dramatise his sermon.&nbsp; He
stands on tiptoe, or he sinks down into his desk, he points his
finger, and shrugs up his shoulders.&nbsp; He has a considerable
share of poetical and oratorical power, but he does not give you
an idea of much literary culture.&nbsp; He does not bear you away
&ldquo;far, far above this lower world, up where eternal ages
roll.&rdquo;&nbsp; You find that it was scarce worth while coming
all the way from New York to London, unless the Rev. Gentleman
has much more to say, and in a better manner, than the sermon
delivered in Store-street.&nbsp; Of course I am not a
Spiritualist.&nbsp; I am one of the profane&mdash;I am little
better than one of the wicked, though I, and all men who are not
beasts, feel that man is spirit as well as <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>flesh; that
he is made in the image of his Maker; that the inspiration of the
Almighty giveth him understanding.&nbsp; Spiritualism in this
sense is old as Adam and Eve, old as the day when Jehovah,
resting from his labours, pronounced them to be good.&nbsp; But
this is not the Spiritualism of Mr. Harris, and of the organ of
his denomination, <i>The Spiritual Magazine</i>.&nbsp; That
spirits appear to us&mdash;that they move tables&mdash;that they
express their meaning by knocks, form the great distinctive
peculiarity of Spiritualism, and they are things which people in
our days are many of them more and more beginning to
believe.&nbsp; At any rate the Spiritualists of the new school
ought not to be angry with us.&nbsp; Mr. Howitt writes,
&ldquo;Moles don&rsquo;t believe in eagles, nor even skylarks;
they believe in the solid earth and earth-worms;&mdash;things
which soar up into the air, and look full at the noon sun, and
perch on the tops of mountains, and see wide prospect of the
earth and air, of men and things, are utterly incomprehensible,
and therefore don&rsquo;t exist, to moles.&nbsp; Things which,
like skylarks, mount also in the air, to bathe their tremulous
pinions in the living &aelig;ther, and in the floods of golden
sunshine, and behold the earth beneath; the more green, and soft,
and beautiful, because they see the heavens above them, and pour
out exulting melodies which are the fruits and streaming delights
of and in these things, are equally incomprehensible to moles,
which, having only eyes of the size of pins&rsquo; heads, and no
ears that ordinary eyes can discover, neither <i>can</i> see the
face of heaven, nor hear the music <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of the
spheres, nor any other music.&nbsp; Learned pigs don&rsquo;t
believe in pneumatology, nor in astronomy, but in
gastronomy.&nbsp; They believe in troughs, pig-nuts, and
substantial potatoes.&nbsp; Learned pigs <i>see</i> the wind, or
have credit for it&mdash;but that other
&Pi;&nu;&epsilon;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha;, which we translate <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span>, they most learnedly ignore.&nbsp;
Moles and learned pigs were contemporaries of Adam, and have
existed in all ages, and, therefore, they <i>know</i> that there
are no such things as eagles, or skylarks and their songs; no
suns, skies, heavens, and their orbs, or even such sublunary
objects as those we call men and things.&nbsp; They <i>know</i>
that there is nothing real, and that there are no genuine
entities, but comfortable dark burrows, earthworms, pig-troughs,
pig-nuts, potatoes, and the like substantials.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
this be so,&mdash;and Mr. Howitt is an old man and ought to know,
especially when he says there are not in London at this time
half-a-dozen literary or scientific men who, had they lived in
Christ&rsquo;s time, would have believed in him&mdash;well, there
is no hope for us.&nbsp; Spiritualism is beyond our reach; it is
a thing too bright for us.&nbsp; It is high, we cannot attain
unto it.&nbsp; The other Sunday night, Mr. Harris was very
spiritual, at any rate, very impractical and unworldly.&nbsp; At
the close of the service he informed us that some few of his
sermons, containing an outline of his religious convictions, were
for sale at the doors, and would be sold at one penny and a half,
a mere insignificant sum, just sufficient to cover the expense of
paper and printing.&nbsp; On inquiring, we found, of the three
sermons, one was <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>published at three-halfpence, one at
twopence, and one at fourpence, prices which, if we may judge by
the copy we purchased, would yield a fair profit, if the sale
were as great as it seemed to be on Sunday night.</p>
<p>But Mr. Harris is a poet&mdash;there is not such another in
the universe.&nbsp; <i>The Golden Age</i> opens thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As many ages as it took to form<br />
The world, it takes to form the human race.<br />
Humanity was injured at its birth,<br />
And its existence in the past has been<br />
That of a suffering infant.&nbsp; God through Christ<br />
Appearing, healed that sickness, pouring down<br />
Interior life: so Christ our Lord became<br />
The second Adam, through whom all shall live.<br />
This is our faith.&nbsp; The world shall yet become<br />
The home of that great second Adam&rsquo;s seed;<br />
Christ-forms, both male and female, who from Him<br />
Derive their ever-growing perfectness,<br />
Eventually shall possess the earth,<br />
And speak the rythmic language of the skies,<br />
And mightier miracles than His perform;<br />
They shall remove all sickness from the race,<br />
Cast out all devils from the church and state,<br />
And hurl into oblivion&rsquo;s hollow sea<br />
The mountains of depravity.&nbsp; Then earth,<br />
From the Antarctic to the Arctic Pole,<br />
Shall blush with flowers; the isles and continents<br />
Teem with harmonic forms of bird and beast,<br />
And fruit, and glogious shapes of art more fair<br />
Than man&rsquo;s imagination yet conceived,<br />
Adorn the stately temples of a new<br />
Divine religion.&nbsp; Every human soul<br />
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>A second Adam, and a second Eve,<br />
Shall dwell with its pure counterpart, conjoined<br />
In sacramental marriage of the heart.<br />
God shall be everywhere, and not, as now,<br />
Guessed at, but apprehended, felt and known.&rdquo;&mdash;p.
1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will take, says Mr. Howitt, as a fair specimen of the poetry
and broad Christian philosophy of this spiritual epic, the recipe
for writing a poem.&nbsp; In this, we see how far the
requirements of Spiritualism are beyond the standard of the
requirements of the world in poetry.&nbsp; They include the
widest gatherings of knowledge, and still wider and loftier
virtues and sympathies.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To write a poem, man should be as pure<br
/>
As frost-flowers; every thought should be in tune<br />
To heavenly truth, and Nature&rsquo;s perfect law,<br />
Bathing the soul in beauty, joy, and peace.<br />
His heart should ripen like the purple grape;<br />
His country should be all the universe;<br />
His friends the best and wisest of all time.<br />
He should be universal as the light,<br />
And rich as summer in ripe-fruited love.<br />
He should have power to draw from common things<br />
Essential truth!&mdash;and, rising o&rsquo;er all fear<br />
Of papal devils and of pagan gods,<br />
Of ancient Satans, and of modern ghosts,<br />
Should recognise all spirits as his friends,<br />
And see the worst but harps of golden strings<br />
Discordant now, but destined at the last<br />
To thrill, inspired with God&rsquo;s own harmony,<br />
And make sweet music with the heavenly host.<br />
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>He should forget his private preference<br />
Of country or religion, and should see<br />
All parties and all creeds with equal eye;<br />
His the religion of true harmony;<br />
Christ the ideal of his lofty aim;<br />
The viewless Friend, the Comforter, and Guide,<br />
The joy in grief, whose every element<br />
Of life received in child-like faith,<br />
Becomes a part of impulse, feeling, thought&mdash;<br />
The central fire that lights his being&rsquo;s sun.<br />
He should not limit Nature by the known;<br />
Nor limit God by what is known of him;<br />
Nor limit man by present states and moods;<br />
But see mankind at liberty to draw<br />
Into their lives all Nature&rsquo;s wealth, and all<br />
Harmonious essences of life from God,<br />
And so, becoming god-like in their souls,<br />
And universal in their faculties,<br />
Informing all their age, enriching time,<br />
And blinding up the temple of the world<br />
With massive structures of eternity.<br />
He shall not fail to see how infinite<br />
God is above humanity, nor yet<br />
That God is throned in universal man,<br />
The greater mind of pure intelligence,<br />
Unlimited by states, moods, periods, creeds,<br />
Self-adequate, self-balanced in his love,<br />
And needing nothing and conferring all,<br />
And asking nothing and receiving all,<br />
Akin by love to every loving heart,<br />
By nobleness to every noble mind,<br />
By truth to all who look through natural forms,<br />
And feel the throbbing arteries of law<br />
In every pulse of nature and of man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>The peculiar doctrine of the Spiritualists seems to be
the belief in Spiritual intercourse, and in mediums; as <i>The
Spiritual Magazine</i> tells us &ldquo;the only media we know
accessible to the public are Mrs. Marshal and her niece, of 22,
Red Lion-street, Holborn,&rdquo; we need not give ourselves much
trouble about them.&nbsp; Concerning intercourse with departed
spirits, an American Judge writes, &ldquo;The first thing
demonstrated to us is that we can commune with the spirits of the
departed; that such communion is through the instrumentality of
persons yet living; that the fact of mediumship is the result of
physical organization; that the kind of communion is affected by
moral causes, and that the power, like our other faculties, is
possessed in different degrees, and is capable of improvement by
cultivation,&rdquo; and from this doctrine the believers gather
comfortable assurances.&nbsp; The Judge adds, &ldquo;These things
being established, by means which show a settled purpose and an
intelligent design, they demonstrate man&rsquo;s immortality, and
that in the simplest way, by appeals alike to his reason, to his
affections, and to his senses.&nbsp; They thus show that they
whom we once knew as living on earth do yet live, after having
passed the gates of death, and leave in our minds the
irresistible conclusion, that if they thus live we shall.&nbsp;
This task Spiritualism has already performed on its thousands and
its tens of thousands&mdash;more, indeed, in the last ten years
than by all the pulpits in the land&mdash;and still the work goes
bravely on.&nbsp; God speed it; for it is doing what man&rsquo;s
unaided reason has for ages tried <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>in vain to
do, and what, in this age of infidelity, seemed impossible to
accomplish.&nbsp; Thus, too, is confirmed to us the Christian
religion, which so many have questioned or denied.&nbsp; Not,
indeed, that which sectarianism gives us, nor that which descends
to us from the dark ages, corrupted by selfishness or distorted
by ignorance, but that which was proclaimed through the
spiritualism of Jesus of Nazareth in the simple
injunction&mdash;&lsquo;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
mind.&nbsp; This is the first and great commandment; and the
second is like unto it&mdash;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.&nbsp; On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the case of Mr. Harris, it seems to us, he lays his stress
upon these peculiar doctrines, and rather aims at a universal
Christianity; in all sects he sees goodness, and he would combine
them all into his own.&nbsp; He and his disciples have found what
all the rest are seeking after.&nbsp; His Christianity is the
faith which all good spirits own, which all angels
reverence.&nbsp; Christ came to reveal this faith: the whole
world is but an expression of it; the whole universe but an
illustration of it; and as we become Christ-like, in the
renunciation of self, and the acceptance of the great law of
service in the Lord and to the Lord, more and more we attain to
an internal perception of the verities of that faith.&nbsp; The
Word is opened before us, and the natural universe is perceived
to be its outward illustration.&nbsp; The new church takes its
stand upon this fundamental doctrine of regeneration, and it is
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>to the putting forth of this in art, science,
literature, poetry, preaching, in all the uses of an ordered
life, that the energy of the true churchman is continually, in
the Divine Providence, directed.&nbsp; And to those thus
regenerated it is given to become mediums.&nbsp; Mr. Harris, in
his sermon preached at the Marylebone Literary and Scientific
Institution, May 29, 1859, says: &ldquo;Any man, good or bad, can
become a medium for spirits.&nbsp; I have seen the vilest and the
most degraded made the organs through which spirits utterly lost,
yet with something of the beams of the fallen archangel&rsquo;s
faded brightness lingering in the intellect&mdash;I say I have
seen such, as well as others, earnest, sincere, and worthy,
become the organs of communication between the visible and
invisible spirits.&nbsp; But no man can become a medium, an organ
or oracle for the Spirit, for the Word made flesh, giving to
every man according to his will, until he hath passed through the
door of penitence&mdash;until he hath gone up through the gateway
of a sincere conversion, or turning from his evil&mdash;until he
hath consecrated himself to the great law of right&mdash;until he
hath voluntarily taken up all the burdens which God in his
providence, whether social, or domestic, or moral, has imposed
upon him&mdash;until, at any cost or any hazard, he hath sought
to do, in his daily life, those things which God in His word doth
most authoritatively and continually command.&nbsp; All such may,
all such do, become, all such are, the <i>mediums</i> of the Lord
Christ, omnipotent, omnipresent, and eternal, walking, as the
Divine Man, in the midst of the paradise <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of the
angels.&nbsp; Breathing forth His breath, and so vivifying the
very air which the angels respire and live, He breathes down that
great <i>aura</i> upon us continually.&nbsp; In prayer, and in
the good self-sacrificing life, we drink in that
<i>aura</i>.&nbsp; The breath of God inflows into the lungs; the
thought of God streams into consciousness; the energies of God
are directed to the will; man, weak, becomes strong; man,
ignorant, becomes wise; man, narrow, becomes broad; man,
sectarian, becomes catholic and liberal; man, self-conceited,
becomes reverent and humble; man, transformed from the image of
the tiger, the ape, the serpent, takes upon himself, in Christ,
the angels&rsquo; image.&nbsp; And as we drink in more and more
of this Divine Spirit, our path in life&mdash;the path of humble
uses (not the path of self-seeking ambition; not the path of
prying curiosity), groweth brighter and brighter unto the perfect
day.&rdquo;</p>

ABOUT COAL.</h2>
<p>I am sitting by my sea-coal fire, and, from the clear way in
which it burns, and the peculiarly pleasant warmth it seems to
give out, I have every reason to believe that the thermometer is
below the freezing point, that the ground is hard as iron, and
that before to-morrow&rsquo;s sun rises, Jack Frost will not only
have lavishly strewn the earth with pearls, but have sketched
fairy landscapes innumerable on my window-panes.&nbsp; Ah, well,
it matters little to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The storm without might rain and ristle,<br
/>
Tam did na mind the storm a whistle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The respected partner of my joys and sorrows has retired to
roost, far away in the nursery the maternal pledges of our
affection have done ditto.&nbsp; Unless an amorous member of that
inestimable class of public servants&mdash;the metropolitan
police&mdash;be at this moment engaged in a furtive flirtation
with the cook, I have no reason to believe that, beside myself,
any of my limited establishment is awake.&nbsp; My boots are
off&mdash;I have an old coat on&mdash;I have done my day&rsquo;s
work&mdash;I don&rsquo;t owe <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>anybody any
money (the reader need not believe this)&mdash;I poke the
fire&mdash;I light a cigar&mdash;and think there is nothing like
a good fire after all.</p>
<p>I am thankful I am not in Paris now: I take down my French
Pocket Dictionary, published by Orr in 1850, and cannot find the
French for fire-place; I find firearms, fire-ball, fire-brand,
fire-brush, fire-cross, fire-lock, but no fire-place.&nbsp; Ah,
here it is (fire-side, <i>foyer</i>&mdash;substantive,
masculine); but, to make quite sure, I turn to the
French-English, and I turn up <i>foyer</i> there; and, here, I
find it means, &ldquo;heat, tiring-room, green-room,&rdquo; and
so on.&nbsp; Well, am I not right? there is nothing like an
English fire-place after all.&nbsp; The Germans are not much
better off than the French; the German porcelain stove, for
instance, standing in the middle of the room, like a monument,
and nearly filling it, is not for a second to be compared with a
jolly English fire; besides, it is very dangerous, and, when the
flue gets stopped is, I was going to write, as great a murderer
as a medical man.&nbsp; Can I ever forget how when I lived in the
Kirchen Strasse of a far-famed and delightful city, distant about
700 miles from where I write, how one morning I came down-stairs
to have my <i>fr&uuml;hst&uuml;ck</i>, and how, in the very
middle of my meal, I felt an uncomfortable sensation, as a
gigantic Dane was reading to me a memorial he was about to
address to the British government?&nbsp; May I tell the reader
how at first I thought the document to which I have referred
might have something to do with it?&nbsp; Will he forgive me, if
I narrate how, at length, I gradually <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>came to the
conclusion that the cause was in the atmosphere, which seemed to
be splitting my head, and swelling out my body to the point of
bursting? can he imagine my deplorable situation when I became
insensible, and when I recovered consciousness found that I had
been poisoned by the fumes of charcoal, and that I should then
and there have shuffled off this mortal coil, had not my Danish
friend, for a wonder, lifted up his eyes from his precious
document, and, seeing me go off, thrown open the window, and, in
a polyglottic way, called for help?&nbsp; Truly, then, may I say,
that, for comfort, and for safety, and for warmth, if you can
have it pretty nearly all to yourself, and do one side thoroughly
first before you roast the other, there is nothing like an
English fireplace in the world.</p>
<p>Woe is me! the present generation,&mdash;a generation most
assuredly wise in its own eyes, can never know what I, and others
verging on forty, know&mdash;the real luxury of an English fire
after travelling all night as an outside passenger on the top,
say, for instance, of the Royal London and Yarmouth mail.&nbsp;
Pardon my emotion, but I must shut my eyes, and endeavour to
recall the past.&nbsp; It is six o&rsquo;clock on a night cold as
that in which I now write; I am at the ancient hostelry, now gone
to the dogs, known as the White Horse, Fetter Lane, on the top of
the mail aforesaid.&nbsp; The many-caped coachman, has clambered
up into his seat; I sit by his side, perched somewhat like a
mummy; outside and in we are full of passengers.&nbsp; The
red-coated guard blows <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>cheerily on the far-resounding
horn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; says the coachman, and
four faultless greys, impatient of restraint, rush forth with
their living load: in a twinkling we stoop under the ancient
gateway, and turn into Fetter Lane; now we cautiously descend
Holborn Hill, skilfully we are steered through Cheapside, past
the Mansion House, through Cornhill, along dark and sullen
Leadenhall, Whitechapel, all glaring with gas and butcher&rsquo;s
meat; our driver gives the horses their heads, and our pace
becomes pleasant.&nbsp; We pass Bow Church, and the bridge at
Stratford, and now we have left the gaslights far behind, above
us is the grand dome of heaven studded with its myriads of
stars.&nbsp; Hedge and field far and near are covered with a
mantle of virgin snow.&nbsp; The traffic on the road has trodden
it into firmness, and on we speed till we reach Romford, not then
as now known all over London for its ales.&nbsp; I believe these
ales are the occasion of an anecdote, which I may here
repeat:&mdash;Two friends went into a public-house and were
regaled plentifully with them, but not finding them so strong as
they wished were much disgusted, and rose to go; however, they
had not gone far before the ale began to tell; one traveller soon
found himself in a ditch on one side of the road, while his
friend was prostrate in another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Holloa,&rdquo; said
the one to the other, &ldquo;that ale war&rsquo;nt so bad as I
thought.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; was the reply of his
now apparently-satisfied friend.&nbsp; But here we are at
Romford.&nbsp; Fresh cattle are standing ready to take the place
of the four who have gallantly drawn us hither.&nbsp; But there
is <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>time to jump down, and &ldquo;have a drop of summut
short,&rdquo; to catch a glimpse from the most glorious of fires,
and to feel for the buxom landlady, and her clean and
rosy-cheeked Hebes, very strong feelings of personal
regard.&nbsp; &ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; cries the ostler, and away
we rush from this fairy land, as it seems to us, out into the
cold dark night; the guard blows his horn; curtains are drawn on
one side as we pass, that, out of warm rooms, curious eyes may
look on us.&nbsp; The pikekeeper bids us, for him, an unusually
cheerful good-night, and by this time some of the old pilots
returning to Southwold, or Lowestoft, or Yarmouth, after having
been with vessels up the Thames, cheered by the contents of
various libations, wake the dull ear of night with songs
occasionally amatory, but chiefly of a nautical character; and if
there is a chorus,&mdash;why, we can all join in that; are we not
jolly companions, every one?&nbsp; Does not this beat railway
travelling?&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe you, my boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
say the present race of men have no conception of this.&nbsp;
Why, look at a London omnibus; for nine months out of the twelve
a cockney can&rsquo;t ride, even from the Bank to Pimlico,
without getting inside.&nbsp; A friend of mine, one of the good
old sort, rides into town winter and summer outside a distance of
about nine miles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course you wear a
respirator,&rdquo; said a young cockney to him.&nbsp; My friend
only laughed.&nbsp; When the Royal Yarmouth Mail ran its gay
career, there were no respirators then.&nbsp; What if the night
were cold&mdash;what if snow laid heavily on the
ground&mdash;what if railway rugs were not; did we not sit <!--
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>close together and keep each other warm&mdash;did we not
smoke the most fragrant of weeds&mdash;did we not, while the
coach changed horses, jump down, and, rushing into the cosiest of
bar-parlours (forgive us, J. B. Gough), swallow brandy-and-water
till our faces were as scarlet peonies, and we tingled, down to
the very soles of our feet, with an unwonted heat?&nbsp; A coal
fire then was a sight to cheer the cockles of one&rsquo;s heart,
to look forward to for one long stage, and to think of for
another.&nbsp; But times change, and we with them.&nbsp; The
other day I met one of our mail-coachmen ingloriously driving a
two-pair buss between the City and Norwood; he looked down at his
horses and then up at us with an expression Robson might have
envied.&nbsp; Let me return to coal.&nbsp; Gentle reader, did you
ever go down a coal-pit?&mdash;I once did, and I think, with
Sheridan, it is hardly worth while going down one, when you might
just as well say you had been.&nbsp; I was a stranger then to
coal-pits and collieries, rather greener then than I am now, and
had on a bran-new suit of clothes and patent-leather boots, and
thus accoutred I was let down into the bowels of the earth,
wandered along little ways in beds of coal, past little nooks
where black men were at work, or resting on lumps of coal dining
on bread-and-bacon, and drinking cold tea; and then there were
tramways, and horses drawing the coal to the mouth of the pit,
and boys to drive the horses, and boys to hold lamps, and all
around you was black coal, save where it shone with the
reflection of your light, and beneath you trod in mud, all made
of coal-dust and water, of a <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>character to
ruin patent-leather for ever.&nbsp; I was not sorry, I assure
you, when I left the lower regions, and was hauled up to the
light of day.&nbsp; Once upon a time, an exciseman at Merthyr
Tydvil was overcome by liquor (for excisemen are but men) and
fell asleep.&nbsp; Excisemen are not generally a very popular
class of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, and there are many who owe
them a grudge.&nbsp; This was the case with our hero.&nbsp;
Accordingly, the enemy, in the shape of half-a-dozen dusky
colliers, made their appearance, and deposited their unconscious
prize,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Full many a fathom deep,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as Mr. Campbell says, in a coal pit.&nbsp; Alas! the
inspiration of wine is but short-lived.&nbsp; From his glorious
dreams of marble halls the exciseman awoke; wonderingly he opened
his eyes and looked around.&nbsp; Where was he?&nbsp; To what
dark and dolorous shades had he been conveyed?&nbsp; That
conscience which does make cowards of us all answered the
question:&mdash;he had been for his sins conveyed to that fearful
locality which a popular clergyman once told his hearers he would
not shock their feelings by naming in so well-bred and
respectable an assembly; there he was, far away from the light of
the sun and the haunts of men.&nbsp; Everything around him was
dark and drear.&nbsp; At length a faint glimmer of light appeared
in the distance.&nbsp; It came nearer and nearer, by its light he
saw a form he thought resembled the human, but of that he was not
quite sure.&nbsp; The exciseman felt with Hamlet:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>&ldquo;Be thou a spirit of health or
goblin damned.<br />
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,<br />
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,<br />
Thou comest in such a questionable shape<br />
That I will speak to thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly he spoke, and very naturally asked the new-corner,
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I was when I lived
on earth an exciseman, but now I am&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; exclaimed the interrogator,
as sober as he ever was in his life.&nbsp; But the joke had now
been carried far enough, and the exciseman gladly returned to the
light of day, and the society of his fellow-man.</p>
<p>A coal pit, or rather a coal country, such as that you see
around Merthyr Tydvil, or as you speed on by the Great Northern
to Newcastle, does not give you a bad idea of Pandemonium.&nbsp;
A coal pit is generally situated by the side of some bleak hill
where there are but few signs of life.&nbsp; A cloud of smoke
from the engine, or engines, hangs heavily all round.&nbsp; The
workmen, of whom there may be hundreds, with the exception of a
few boys, who stand at the mouth of the pit to unload the coal
waggons as they come up, or to run them into the tram-road that
connects them with the neighbouring railroad, or canal, are all
under-ground.&nbsp; If you descend, a lighted candle is put into
your hand, and you must grope your way as best you can.&nbsp; If
the vein of coal be a pretty good one you will be able to walk
comfortably without much trouble, but you must mind and not be
run over by the coal waggons always <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>passing
along.&nbsp; As you proceed you will observe numerous passages on
each side which lead to the stalls in which the men work, and
hard work it is, I can assure you: a great block is first
undermined, and then cut out by wedges driven into the solid
coal; I believe the work is chiefly contracted for at so much a
ton.&nbsp; In these little stalls the men sit, and dine, and
smoke.&nbsp; Little else is to be seen in a coal pit.&nbsp; There
are doors by which the air is forced along the different
passages; there are engines by which the water is drained off;
there is constant communication between the upper and the lower
world, all going on with a methodical exactness which can only be
violated with loss of life.&nbsp; Let the engines cease, and
possibly in a couple of hours the pit may be filled with
water.&nbsp; Let a workman, as is too often the case, enter his
stall with a candle instead of with a safety lamp, and an
explosion may occur which may be attended with the loss of many
lives; but the rule is care and regularity, each man doing his
part in a general whole.&nbsp; The mortality in coal mining is
still unusually great.&nbsp; It is ascertained that of the total
number of 220,000 persons employed as colliers, 1000 are killed
annually&mdash;that is to say, the poor collier has 1000 more
chances of being killed at his work than any one of the whole
travelling public has of being killed or injured on English
railways.&nbsp; Dr. Philip Holland read a paper on the subject at
a recent meeting of the Society of Arts.&nbsp; He stated that out
of 8015 deaths by accidents in eight years, 1984 (or about
one-fourth) were caused by explosions.&nbsp; <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Remarkable it
is, that in the northern counties of Durham and Northumberland
(in which one-fourth of the coal is raised, and one-fifth of the
collier population employed) the average deaths per annum from
explosions do not exceed 21 out of 248; and as the average of
such deaths for the whole country, including the Yorkshire,
Lancashire, and Staffordshire districts, is 105, so 143 lives
yearly are lost because the precautions against explosion proved
to be effectual in the extreme north are neglected in all the
other districts.&nbsp; Equally remarkable it is that falls of
roof have caused nearly 1000 more deaths in the eight years than
explosions, although the latter chiefly excite public
feeling.&nbsp; Here, again, the extreme northern district affords
a gratifying contrast with the others, as, out of an average of
371 such accidents yearly, only 49 occur there.&nbsp; It is
suggested that the comparative immunity of the north from this
cause of accident is attributable to the fact, that one man in
six belongs to the safety staff, who are charged with the
superintendence of ventilation, road, and prop making,
&amp;c.&nbsp; In other parts no such person is employed, and the
men in their anxiety to get coal neglect these salutary means of
safety.&nbsp; The next greatest number of fatal accidents occurs
in the shafts, 1734 in the eight years.&nbsp; Here, again, the
cautious north exhibits its superiority, its proportion of
fatalities from this source not being more than a fifth part of
the proportion throughout the country.&nbsp; Other fatalities
there are, principally the result of bad discipline, the <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>employment of too large a proportion of boys under
fifteen years, the use of machinery where hand-pulling would be
preferable, the narrowness of the galleries, and such like.&nbsp;
Dr. Holland notices that the system of government inspection has,
in the southern coal districts, led to the discontinuance of the
services of &ldquo;viewers,&rdquo; or mine engineers, to direct
the operations, which it never was intended to do.&nbsp; Either
these viewers must, as a rule, be reinstated, or the government
system of inspection must be enormously increased.&nbsp; Among
the means suggested to prevent accidents is that of making the
coal owner civilly responsible for accidents caused by the
obvious neglect of reasonable precautions in the working.&nbsp;
In the course of the discussion which followed, it was urged that
the workers should no more be exempted from the penal
consequences of neglect than the employers.</p>
<p>Fancy&mdash;I can do it easily, over my sea-coal
fire&mdash;fancy the coal dug out of the pit, put into a waggon,
that waggon put on a railway&mdash;travelling, it may be, some
distance, and depositing its precious burden in a collier&rsquo;s
hold; imagine this collier put to sea, and safely arrived in the
Thames.&nbsp; As Mr. Cobden said, &ldquo;What next, and
next?&rdquo;&nbsp; Here a new agency comes into play, the coal
cannot come right to my fire.&nbsp; We leave the collier at
Gravesend and land, let us say, at Billingsgate&mdash;never mind
the fish, nor the porters, nor the fair dealers in marine
products.&nbsp; Come right away into Thames Street&mdash;cross it
if you can, for this street, of <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>all London
streets, bears away the palm for being blocked up at all times
and seasons, and this morning there has been a block lasting a
couple of hours; but the people here are used to it, and do not
think it worth while to have recourse to hard words, nor to
repeat sounds very much like oaths, nor to grow red in the face
and threaten each other, as is the case with the angry Jehus of
Cheapside and Holborn Hill.&nbsp; We enter a handsome building by
a semi-circular portico, with Roman Doric columns, and a tower
106 feet high.&nbsp; A beadle in magnificent livery, and of an
unusually civil character&mdash;for beadledom is generally a
terror to our species&mdash;meets us.&nbsp; We wish to see our
friend; right into the middle of a busy group of coal dealers and
factors the beadle rushes, and repeats the name of our friend; up
one story, and then another, and then another, the sound ascends;
our friend hears it, and, rapidly descending, gives us a welcome
as warm as his own fire-side.&nbsp; We begin our voyage of
discovery:&mdash;first we descend and examine a Roman well, in
excellent preservation, discovered in excavating the foundation
of the new building.&nbsp; The water looks thick and muddy, but
they tell you it is clear: but the fact that it ebbs and flows
seems to connect it with the Thames; and Thames water, when taken
opposite Billingsgate, is not generally considered clear.&nbsp;
We again ascend to the ground-floor, which is a rotunda sixty
feet in diameter, covered by a glazed dome seventy-four feet from
the floor.&nbsp; This circular <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>hall has
three tiers of projecting galleries running round it; the floor
is composed of 4000 pieces of inlaid wood, in the form of a
mariner&rsquo;s compass; in the centre is the city shield,
anchor, &amp;c., the dagger blade in the arms being a piece of
mulberry tree, planted by Peter the Great when he worked as a
shipwright in Deptford Dockyard.&nbsp; The place is worth coming
to see&mdash;country cousins ought to look at it; the entrance
vestibule, Mr. Timbs, in his &ldquo;Curiosities of London,&rdquo;
informs us, is richly embellished with vases of fruit, arabesque
foliage, terminal figures, &amp;c.&nbsp; In the rotunda, between
the Raphaelesque scroll-supports, are panels painted with
impersonations of the coal-bearing rivers of England&mdash;the
Thames, Mersey, Severn, Trent, Humber, Aire, Tyne, &amp;c.: and
above them, within flower borders, are figures of Wisdom,
Fortitude, Vigilance, Temperance, Perseverance, Watchfulness,
Justice, and Faith.&nbsp; The arabesques in the first story are
views of coal mines&mdash;Wallsend, Percy, Pit Main,
Regent&rsquo;s Pit, &amp;c.&nbsp; The second and third storey
panels are painted with miners at work; and the twenty-four ovals
at the springing of the dome have, upon a turquoise blue ground,
figures of fossil plants found in coal formations.&nbsp; The
minor ornamentation is flowers, shells, snakes, lizards, and
other reptiles, miners&rsquo; tools and nautical
subjects;&mdash;there you can see all the process of coal mining,
without troubling yourself to go down a mine, and in a small
museum, too small for such a grand building and such a wealthy
trade, curious specimens <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>of fossil
products and coal will make the observer still more learned; but
let us look at the living mass beneath.&nbsp; Some of the men
below are famous city names.&nbsp; There sometimes you may see
Sir James Duke, who came to London a clerk, poor and under-paid,
on board a man-of-war, and who on this Coal Exchange has made a
colossal fortune, and who was made a baronet, he being at the
time Lord Mayor, when the New Exchange was opened by Prince
Albert, on the 29th Oct., 1849, accompanied by the Prince of
Wales and the Princess Royal.&nbsp; Here oftener you may see Hugh
Taylor, M.P., who began life as a cabin-boy, then became a
captain, then was developed into a coal-owner, and who is said to
be a perfect Midas, and possesses an art, very much, thought of
by city people, of turning everything he touches into gold.&nbsp;
On a door just below where we stand is inscribed the name of Lord
Ward, for even noblemen don&rsquo;t mind sullying their fingers
with vulgar trade, if anything is to be made by it.&nbsp; And
there is the name of a Welsh coal-owner, who, some fifty years
back, was a clerk in a certain timber merchant&rsquo;s, at a
guinea a week, and who now, I believe, can raise and ship a
couple of thousand tons of coal a day.&nbsp; Depend upon it there
is some money made by these black diamonds, and the corporation
of London know it, for they have managed to get a tax levied of
one penny on every ton of coals, whether brought by sea or rail
within thirty miles of where we stand.&nbsp; What they do with
the <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>enormous sum thus collected it is impossible to say; it
is true they built this handsome Exchange, at a cost altogether
of &pound;91,167. 11s. 8d., but that is a small part of their
receipts.&nbsp; When the tax was first levied it did not much
matter; about the year 1550 one or two ships sufficed for the
coal trade of London.&nbsp; On Friday, December 2nd, 1859, the
number of ships with cargoes for sale on that day was not less
than 340&mdash;and on an average each ship employed in the coal
trade carries 300 tons of coal.&nbsp; In the month of October
alone there were brought into the London markets 283,849 tons by
sea, and by rail 95,195 tons and three-quarters.&nbsp; Of course
in winter time the trade is very brisk.&nbsp; The retail dealers
in the metropolis will tell you that a few cold days make an
enormous difference in the sale of coals, and the large dealers
are driven to their wits&rsquo; end as to how they can find
enough waggons and horses to enable them to supply their
customers.&nbsp; In the large coal-yards in the winter time the
men are at work from five in the morning till late, very late, at
night.&nbsp; I am thankful for their industry, I hope they are
well paid.</p>
<p>But I have not yet said how the business at the Coal Exchange
is carried on.&nbsp; There are two classes of men connected with
the place,&mdash;the factors, who have a handsomely furnished
room up above, and who elect each other by ballot,&mdash;and the
merchants, who have a room below, to which they pay so much a
year, and to the use of which they also are elected by
ballot.&nbsp; On <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the topmost story of all are the
offices of the gentlemen who collect the city dues, and render
themselves useful in similar ways.&nbsp; When the colliers arrive
at Gravesend, a messenger is sent up with their names and the
number of coals on board, and so on.&nbsp; Each ship is consigned
to a London factor, and in the official room is a large case full
of pigeon-holes, in which the papers for each factor are
deposited; these papers are collected by the factor&rsquo;s
clerks, and with these the factor goes into the market to sell;
for if he does not sell&mdash;unless the charter party permit him
to wait for a second market day&mdash;he has to pay a demurrage
of three-halfpence a ton, a demurrage, however, often submitted
to rather than the coals should be sold at a loss of a shilling
per ton.&nbsp; A bell rings at twelve, and all at once you see,
by the sudden apparition of merchants and factors from the
surrounding offices, that business has commenced; however, little
is done till towards the close at two, the factors till then
holding out for high prices, and the merchants holding
back.&nbsp; I may add that there is very little speculation in
this trade, all is fair and above-board.&nbsp; In the rooms of
the factors, as well as of the merchants, is a daily list of what
vessels have arrived at Gravesend, with what amount of cargo, and
what vessels are on their way, and how many are going up to the
north in ballast; thus the buyer knows as much about the state of
the trade as the seller&mdash;and as he thinks the factor must
sell before the market is over, he waits till the very last
before he concludes his bargain.&nbsp; At the end of the market,
when there is a <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>heavy sale, people get a little
excited.&nbsp; They are also rather more numerous and noisy than
when you first entered, and, besides the regular dealers, a good
many others are present: sailors out of curiosity, captains who
want to know who are the purchasers of their coals, and where
they are to deliver them to; general dealers, who do not belong
either to the Factor&rsquo;s Society or that of the Coal
Merchants&rsquo;; and here and there a lady may be seen gazing
with curious eyes on the groups below.&nbsp; When the sales are
effected, the broker pays the city dues&mdash;for bulk must not
be broken till then under a penalty of five hundred
pounds&mdash;and a gentleman attests the purchases, and publishes
them in a list, sent that evening to all subscribers as the real
authenticated state of the markets for that day.&nbsp; I may as
well say that the market-days are Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday.&nbsp; By way of compendium, I add, that the price of
coals, as given in the daily newspapers, is the price up to the
time when the coals are <i>whipped</i> from the ship to the
merchants&rsquo; barges.&nbsp; It includes, 1st, the value of the
coals at the pit&rsquo;s mouth; 2nd, the expense of transit from
the pit to the ship; 3rd, the freight of the ship to London; 4th,
the dues; and 5th, the whipping.&nbsp; The public then has to
pay, 6th, the merchant for taking it to his wharf and keeping it
there, and his profit; and, 7th, the retailer for fetching it
from the merchant&rsquo;s, and bringing it to their doors.&nbsp;
Of course you may save something by going at once to the
merchant&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The poor cannot do this, and have to pay
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>an extra price on this, as on almost everything they
consume.</p>
<p>And now once more I am by my sea-coal fire, burning up
cheerily in this bleak winter night.&nbsp; Let me light up
another cigar, and indulge in a reverie.&nbsp; I am in a Welsh
port on the Bristol Channel.&nbsp; Yesterday it was a small
borough, with an ancient castle, and an appearance of dirt, and
poverty, and age.&nbsp; To-day its moors have become docks, or
covered with iron roads, its few streets, but lately deserted,
now stretch far away and are teeming with busy life.&nbsp; Where
the heron flew with heavy wings,&mdash;where the sportsman
wandered in search of fowl,&mdash;where idle boys played,
thousands of habitations and warehouses have been planted.&nbsp;
There the snort of the iron horse is heard morning, noon, and
night.&nbsp; There the ships of almost every country under heaven
float.&nbsp; There you meet German, and French, and Dane, and
American, and Italian, and Greek.&nbsp; What collects that
many-coloured and many-language-speaking crowd?&nbsp; Where has
come the money to build those big warehouses, to excavate those
capacious docks, to plant those iron rails, to make on this
ancient desert a Babel busier and more populous than Tyre or
Sidon of old?&nbsp; The answer is soon given.&nbsp; Up those
bleak hills, a few miles away, are the coal-works, a little
further still are more, a little further still are more, beyond
them are the iron-works, and thus we go on, coal and iron
everywhere, all fast being changed by magic industry into
gold.&nbsp; Nature has destined England to be the workshop of the
world.&nbsp; <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>She sent here the Saxon race, she
filled the bowels of the land with ores more valuable than those
of Potosi.&nbsp; To France and Spain she gave wine; to the
countries lying on the Baltic, timber and grain; to Russia, hemp
and tallow; to Lombardy, its rich silk; to Calabria, its oil; to
Ceylon, its spices; to Persia, its pearls; to America, its
cotton; to China, its tea; to California, its glittering gold;
but she has given us the iron and the coal&mdash;without which
all her other gifts were vain&mdash;and with which all the others
can be bought.&nbsp; To the rank we take amidst the nations of
the earth, from the first we were destined.&nbsp; Ours is not the
blue sky of Italy, nor the warm breath of the sunny south, but it
is an atmosphere that fits man for persevering industry and daily
toil.&nbsp; Let us, then, brace ourselves up for our
mission.&nbsp; Let us proclaim the dignity of labour&mdash;its
beneficent effects&mdash;its more than magical results.&nbsp; Let
us honour the workman, whether he stand at the loom or plough the
field&mdash;or sail</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&mdash;Beyond
the sunset<br />
Or the baths of all the western stars,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or labour in the dark and dangerous recesses of the
mine.&nbsp; Thus shall we build up a barricade against the
murderous art of war, teach all the world the advantages of
peace, and make manifest to the nations how to live.</p>
<p>One word more&mdash;don&rsquo;t let the reader go away with
the idea that there is likely to be a dearth of coals in his
time.&nbsp; Let him make merry by his own fireside, and not vex
his small brain about what the world will be when the years have
died away.&nbsp; A writer in the <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span><i>Times</i>,
of May 24th, 1860, says, &ldquo;As a good deal of anxiety has
been recently shown regarding the probable extinction of the
resources of steam coal in Wales, it may be interesting to state
that, by the successful results of the prosecution for the last
five years of the operations of the Navigation Works at Aberdare,
near Merthyr, all fears upon the subject may be discarded.&nbsp;
This pit is the largest in the world, being 18 feet in diameter
and 370 yards in depth.&nbsp; The estimate of its workings is
1000 tons per day.&nbsp; The expenses thus far have been
&pound;130,000, exclusive of the value of waggons,
&amp;c.&mdash;&pound;35,000.&nbsp; The ground is of a most
difficult nature, the layers often extending 15 feet without a
bed, crack, fissure, or any opening whatever.&nbsp; The rock had
all to be blasted with gunpowder.&nbsp; The resources of the seam
are comparatively boundless, the property extending seven miles
from Taff up to Cwm Neal, and three miles in width, covering 4000
to 5000 acres of &lsquo;4 foot coal.&rsquo;&nbsp; The royalty is
for 99 years, and is held by a firm, composed of Mr. John Nixon,
the well-known colliery proprietor at Merthyr; Mr. Hugh Taylor,
M.P. for Tynemouth; and Mr. W. Cory, the large coal contractor of
London.&nbsp; The commencement of the use of this smokeless coal
afloat began about 1840, on board the Thames steamboats, to work
Penn&rsquo;s engines.&nbsp; In the same year a cargo was shipped
to Nantes, and given away to the French for trial, with the sole
condition that the engineer should throw it into the furnaces and
leave it alone to stoke itself.&nbsp; Next, the sugar refiners
<!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>adopted it, as they suffered considerably if the steam
was not kept up to a pressure of 50lbs., and if allowed to fall
below that rate their works were completely stopped.&nbsp; With
the Welsh coal they cleaned out their fires but once instead of
twice, and thereby effected a saving in the working day of three
hours and a half.&nbsp; The French river steamers followed, and
here the only objection raised was, that without the long trail
of smoke from the funnel their customers would not be able to see
their vessels approaching from a distance.&nbsp; The French
Government then became convinced of its efficiency, and, adopting
it, have adhered to its exclusive use ever since.&nbsp; Other
Governments have likewise profited by its advantages: but,
although it is consumed in the Peninsular and Oriental
Company&rsquo;s fleet, the Royal Mail, Cunard&rsquo;s, and
others, the English Government has not hitherto availed itself of
it.&nbsp; The embryo town of Mountain Ash, with already a
population of 5,000, has recently been the scene of great
rejoicings, as the &lsquo;winning&rsquo; or striking of so
enormous a seam it is expected will bring with it additional
prosperity and considerable increase to its
neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>

44</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
HIGHGATE.</h2>
<p>If I were inclined to be dull, I would say Highgate is a
village to the north of London, with an ancient history, a great
deal of which the reader, if he be not a fool, can imagine, and
with a very fine geological formation, indicative of salt-water
where it is now very difficult to find fresh.&nbsp; In order,
also, that I may not weary my reader, and establish a cheap
reputation for a great deal of learning, I will frankly confess
that Highgate, means High Gate, and nothing more.&nbsp; In old
times, right away from Islington Turnpike-Gate to Enfield Chase,
there was a magnificent forest, and part of this forest extended
as far as Highgate.&nbsp; Down in the very heart of it, in
Hornsey, the Bishop of London had a castle, and of the Park
attached to it Highgate formed a part.&nbsp; When the old road to
the north was found impassable, a new one was formed over the
hill, and through the Bishop&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; In those days
pious bishops levied toll; to collect this toll a gate was
erected, and here was Highgate, and truly does it deserve the
name.&nbsp; It is said the hill is 400 feet <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>above the top
of St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Be this as it may, near London, a
lovelier spot is rarely to be met with.&nbsp; Artists, poets,
parties in search of the picturesque, cannot do better than visit
Highgate.&nbsp; At every turn you come to the most beautiful
prospects.&nbsp; When London will consume its own smoke, if that
time ever does arrive, the view from Highgate, across the great
city, will be the grandest in the world.&nbsp; On a clear day,
standing in the Archway Road&mdash;that road esteemed such a
wonder of engineering in its day, and forming such a disastrous
property for its shareholders (the &pound;50 shares may be bought
at about 18s. a share)&mdash;you may see across the valley of the
Thames as far as the Kent and Surrey hills looming obscurely in
the distance.&nbsp; Close to the Archway Tavern, but on the other
side of the road, is a lofty old-fashioned brick mansion, said to
have been inhabited by Marshal Wade, the military hero who did so
much for the wars of Scotland, and whose memory is still
preserved in the following very remarkable couplet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Had you seen these roads before they were
made,<br />
You would lift up your hands and bless General Wade.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, from the top of this mansion you can see no less than
seven English counties.&nbsp; The number seems almost fabulous,
and if, in accordance with a well-established rule in such cases,
we only believe half we hear, enough is left to convince us that
the view is one of no common kind; all that is wanted to make the
scene perfect is a little bit of water.&nbsp; From every part of
the <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>hill, in spite of builders and buildings, views of
exquisite beauty may be obtained.&nbsp; Going down towards
Kentish Town, the hill where her Majesty was nearly dashed to
pieces by the running away of the horses of her carnage (her
royal arms on a public-house still preserves the tradition and
the memory of the man who saved her at the peril of his life),
past where Mr. Bodkin the Barrister lives, past where William and
Mary Howitt live, past where the rich Miss Burdett Coutts has a
stately mansion, which, however, to the great grief of the
neighbourhood, she rarely adorns with her presence, what pleasant
views we have before us.&nbsp; It is the same going down past St.
Joseph&rsquo;s Retreat to Holloway; and in Swain&rsquo;s Lane,
another lane leading back to Kentish Town, you might fancy you
were in Arcady itself.&nbsp; Again, stand on the brow of the
hill, with your backs to London, looking far away to distant
Harrow, or ancient Barnet, what a fair plain lies at your feet,
clothed with cheerful villas, and looking bright and warm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Upon this hill,&rdquo; says Norden, &ldquo;is most
pleasant dwelling, yet not so pleasant as healthful, for the
expert inhabitants there report that divers who have been long
visited with sicknesse not curable by physicke, have in a short
time repaired their health by that sweet salutary
air.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1661, the Spanish Ambassador, Count
Gondomar, excuses his absence from the English court on the plea
that he had gone to his retreat in Highgate &ldquo;to take the
fresh aire.&rdquo;&nbsp; The associations connected with Highgate
are of the most interesting character.&nbsp; It was <!-- page
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>coming up Highgate Hill that Dick Whittington heard the
bells prophesying that if he would return he would be Lord Mayor
of London; a public-house still marks the spot.&nbsp; It was at
the bottom of Highgate Hill that the great Bacon&mdash;the wisest
and not the meanest of mankind, that lie is at length exploded,
and must disappear from history&mdash;caught the cold of which he
died.&nbsp; &ldquo;The cause of his Lordship&rsquo;s
death,&rdquo; writes Aubrey, who professed to have received the
information from Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury, &ldquo;was trying
an experiment as he was taking the air in the coach with Dr.
Winterbourne, a Scotchman, physician to the king.&nbsp; Towards
Highgate snow lay on the ground, and it came into my Lord&rsquo;s
thoughts why flesh might not be preserved in snow as in
salt.&nbsp; They were resolved they would try the experiment
presently.&nbsp; They alighted out of the coach, and went into a
poor woman&rsquo;s house at the bottom of Highgate Hill, and
bought a hen and stuffed the body with snow, and my Lord did help
to do it himself.&nbsp; The snow so chilled him that he
immediately fell so ill that he could not return to his lodgings,
but went to the Earl of Arundel&rsquo;s house at Highgate, where
they put him into a good bed warmed with a pan, but it was a damp
bed, that had not been laid in for about a year before, which
gave him such a cold, that in two or three days, as I remember,
he (Hobbes) told me he died of suffocation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Arundel house here referred to does not seem to be the Arundel
House still existing in Highgate, on the left-hand side as you
come up the main <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>road from Islington.&nbsp; The house
now bearing that name is said to have been a residence of Nell
Gwynne, and during that period was visited by the merry monarch
himself.&nbsp; The creation of the title of Duke of St. Albans,
which is related to have been obtained by Nell Gwynne in so
extraordinary a manner from King Charles, is said to have taken
place at this house.&nbsp; A marble bath, surrounded by curious
and antique oak-work, is there associated with her name.&nbsp; As
the house is now in the possession of a celebrated antiquarian,
the Rev. James Yates, M.A., it is to be hoped that it will be as
little modernised as possible.&nbsp; More hallowed memories
appertain to the next house we come to.</p>
<p>Andrew Marvel, patriot, was born, 1620, at
Kingston-upon-Hull.&nbsp; After taking his degree of B.A. at
Trinity College, Cambridge, he went abroad, and at Rome he wrote
the first of those satirical poems which obtained him such
celebrity.&nbsp; In 1635, Marvel returned to England, rich in the
friendship of Milton, who a couple of years after, thus
introduced him to Bradshaw: &ldquo;I present to you Mr. Marvel,
laying aside those jealousies and that emulation which mine own
condition might suggest to me by bringing in such a
coadjutor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was most likely,&rdquo; writes
Mrs. S. C. Hall, &ldquo;during this period that he inhabited the
cottage at Highgate, opposite to the house in which lived part of
the family of Cromwell.&rdquo;&nbsp; How Marvel became M.P. for
his native town&mdash;how he was probably the last representative
paid by his constituents, (a much better practice that than <!--
page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>ours of representatives paying their
constituents)&mdash;how his &ldquo;Rehearsal Transposed,&rdquo; a
witty and sarcastic poem, not only humbled Parker, but, in the
language of Bishop Burnet, &ldquo;the whole party, for from the
king down to the tradesman the book was read with
pleasure,&rdquo;&mdash;how he spurned the smiles of the venal
court, and sleeps the sleep of the just in St.
Giles-in-the-Fields, are facts known to all.&nbsp; Mason has made
Marvel the hero of his &ldquo;Ode to Independence,&rdquo; and
thus alludes to his incorruptible integrity:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In awful poverty his honest muse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Walks forth vindictive through a venal land;<br />
In vain corruption sheds her golden dews,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In vain oppression lifts her iron hand,&mdash;<br />
He scorns them both, and armed with truth alone,<br />
Bids lust and folly tremble on the throne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other side of the way is an old stately red-brick
building, now a school, and well known as Cromwell House.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t find that Cromwell lived there, but assuredly his
son-in-law, Ireton, did.&nbsp; His arms are elaborately carved on
the ceiling of the state-rooms, the antique stair-case and
apartments retain their originality of character, and the mansion
is altogether one of very great interest.&nbsp; Mr. Prickett, in
his History of Highgate, tells us Cromwell House is supposed to
have been built by the Protector, whose name it bears, about the
year 1630, as a residence for General Ireton, who married his
daughter, and was one of the commanders of his army; it is,
however, said to have been the residence of Oliver <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Cromwell himself, but no mention is made, either in
history or his biography, of his ever having lived at
Highgate.&nbsp; Tradition states there was a subterraneous
passage from this house to the Mansion House, which stood where
the new church now stands, but of its reality no proof has
hitherto been adduced.&nbsp; Cromwell House was evidently built
and internally ornamented in accordance with the taste of its
military occupant.&nbsp; The staircase, which is of handsome
proportions, is richly decorated with oaken carved figures,
supposed to have been of persons in the General&rsquo;s army, in
their costumes, and the balustrades filled in with devices
emblematical of warfare.&nbsp; From the platform on the top of
the mansion may be seen a perfect panorama of the surrounding
country.</p>
<p>On the hill was the house of Mr. Coniers, Bencher and
Treasurer of the Middle Temple, from which, on the 3rd of June,
1611, the Lady Arabella escaped.&nbsp; Her sin was that she had
married Mr. Seymour, afterwards Marquis of Hertford.&nbsp; Her
fate was sad; she was recaptured and died in the Tower.&nbsp; Sir
Richard Baker, author of &ldquo;The Chronicles of the Kings of
England,&rdquo; resided at Highgate.&nbsp; Dr. Sacheverel, that
foolish priest, died at Highgate.&nbsp; But a greater man than
any we have yet named lived here.&nbsp; I speak of S. T.
Coleridge, who lived in a red-brick house in the
&ldquo;Grove&rdquo; twenty years, with his biographer, Mr.
Gillman, which house is now inhabited by Mr. Blatherwick,
surgeon.&nbsp; It is much to be regretted that Gillman&rsquo;s
Life was never completed, but a monument <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>in the new
church, and a grave in the old churchyard, mark the
philosopher&rsquo;s connection with Highgate.&nbsp; Carlyle has
given us a description of what he calls Coleridge&rsquo;s
philosophical moonshine.&nbsp; I met a lady who remembers the
philosopher well, as a snuffy old gentleman, very fond of
stroking her hair, and seeing her and another little girl
practise their dancing lessons.&nbsp; On one occasion Irving came
with the philosopher.&nbsp; As the great man&rsquo;s clothes were
very shabby, and as he took so much snuff as to make her sneeze
whenever she went near him, my lady informant had rather a poor
opinion of the author of &ldquo;Christabel&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Ancient Mariner.&rdquo;&nbsp; A contemporary writer, more
akin in philosophy to Coleridge than Thomas Carlyle, and more
able to appreciate the wondrous intellect of the man than the
little lady to whom I have already referred, says, &ldquo;I was
in his company about three hours, and of that time he spoke
during two and three-quarters.&nbsp; It would have been
delightful to listen as attentively, and certainly as easy for
him to speak just as well, for the next forty-eight hours.&nbsp;
On the whole, his conversation, or rather monologue, is by far
the most interesting I ever read or heard of.&nbsp; Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s talk, with which it is obvious to compare it,
seems to me immeasurably inferior.&nbsp; It is better balanced
and squared, and more ponderous with epithets, but the spirit and
flavour and fragrance, the knowledge and the genius, are all
wanting.&nbsp; The one is a house of brick, the other a quarry of
jasper.&nbsp; It is painful to observe in Coleridge, that with
all the kindness <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>and glorious far-seeing intelligence
of his eye, there is a glare in it, a light half-unearthly and
morbid.&nbsp; It is the glittering eye of the Ancient
Mariner.&nbsp; His cheek too shows a flush of over-excitement,
the ridge of a storm-cloud at sunset.&nbsp; When he dies,
another, and the greatest of their race, will rejoin the few
immortals, the ill-understood and ill-requited, who have walked
this earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had Coleridge ever a more genial
visitant than the farmer-looking, but eloquent and philanthropic
Chalmers, who in 1839 came from Scotland to London, and of course
clomb up Highgate Hill to pay a visit to Coleridge, he
says&mdash;&ldquo;Half-an-hour with Coleridge was filled up
without intermission by one continuous flow of eloquent discourse
from that prince of talkers.&nbsp; He began, in answer to the
common inquiries as to his health, by telling of a fit of
insensibility in which, three weeks before, he had lain for
thirty-five minutes.&nbsp; As sensibility returned, and before he
had opened his eyes, he uttered a sentence about the fugacious
nature of consciousness, from which he passed to a discussion of
the singular relations between the soul and the body.&nbsp;
Asking for Mr. Irving, but waiting for no reply, he poured out an
eloquent tribute of his regard, mourning pathetically that such a
man should be throwing himself away.&nbsp; Mr. Irving&rsquo;s
book on the &lsquo;Human Nature of Christ&rsquo; in his analysis
was minute to absurdity; one would imagine that the pickling and
preserving were to follow, it was so like a cookery-book.&nbsp;
Unfolding then his own scheme of the Apocalypse&mdash;talking of
the <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>mighty contrast between its Christ and the Christ of the
Gospel narrative, Mr. Coleridge said that Jesus did not come now
as before, meek and gentle, healing the sick and feeding the
hungry, and dispensing blessings all around; but he came on a
white horse, and who were his attendants?&mdash;Famine and War
and Pestilence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poets have always been partial to Highgate.&nbsp; William
and Mary Howitt live there at this day.&nbsp; Florence
Nightingale has also there taken up her abode.&nbsp; The German
religious reformer, Ronge, lives at the foot of Highgate
Hill.&nbsp; Nicholas Rowe was educated there.&nbsp; It was in one
of the lanes leading to Highgate that Coleridge met Keats and
Hunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is death in the hand,&rdquo; said he to
Hunt, as he shook hands with the author of Endymion.&nbsp;
Painters and artists have also been partial to Highgate.&nbsp;
George Morland would stay at the Bull, an inn still existing,
weeks at a time, and, we may be sure, ran up very handsome
scores.&nbsp; An incident that occurred to Hogarth while at
Highgate made an artist of him.&nbsp; The tale is thus told by
Walpole&mdash;&ldquo;During his apprenticeship he set out one
Sunday with two or three companions on an excursion to
Highgate.&nbsp; The weather being very hot, they went into a
public-house, where they had not been long before a quarrel arose
between some persons in the same room; one of the disputants
struck the other on the head with a quart pot and cut him very
much; the blood running down the man&rsquo;s face, together with
the agony of the wound, which had distorted the features into a
most hideous grin, presented Hogarth, <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>who showed
himself thus early apprised of the mode nature had intended he
should pursue, with a subject too laughable to be
overlooked.&nbsp; He drew out his pencil, and produced on the
spot one of the most ludicrous figures that was ever seen.&nbsp;
What rendered the piece the more valuable was, that it exhibited
an exact likeness of the man, with the portrait of his
antagonist, and the figures in caricature of the principal
persons gathered around him.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the names
associated with Highgate I find to be that of Hogarth&rsquo;s
enemy, Wilkes, patriot or demagogue.&nbsp; In his Life I read,
&ldquo;Mr. Wilkes was of the Established Church, but after he was
married he often went to Meeting.&nbsp; He lived in a splendid
style, and kept a very elegant and sumptuous table for his
friends.&nbsp; Among the numerous persons who visited this family
were Mr. Mead, an eminent drysalter on London Bridge, with his
wife and daughter, who, being also Dissenters, frequently went to
the Meeting-house in Southwood Lane, Highgate, in Mr.
Wilkes&rsquo;s coach, which was always drawn by six horses, such
was his love of external appearance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Going still
further back, more renowned characters appear on Highgate
Hill.&nbsp; After the memorable battle of Bosworth Field, in
which the usurper, Richard, had been slain, it was at Highgate
that the victorious Richmond was met by the citizens of London on
his triumphal approach to the metropolis.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
met,&rdquo; writes Lambert, &ldquo;by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
in scarlet robes, with a great number of citizens on
horseback.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Gunpowder Plot is also connected <!--
page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>with this interesting locality.&nbsp; It is said, while
that old villain, Guy Fawkes, was preparing &ldquo;to blow up
king and parliament, with Jehu and Powdire,&rdquo; the rest of
the conspirators had assembled on Highgate Hill to witness the
catastrophe; indeed, a driver of the Barnet mail&mdash;I fear not
the best authority in the world on antiquarian matters&mdash;went
so far on one occasion as to point out to the writer a bit of an
old wall, a little beyond Marvel&rsquo;s house on the same side
of the way, as a part of the identical house in which those very
evil-disposed gentlemen met.&nbsp; A subterraneous way is also
said to have existed from the site of the present church to
Cromwell House, and thence to Islington.&nbsp; To me the story
seems somewhat doubtful, but the reader is at full liberty to
believe it or not as he likes.&nbsp; Let us now speak of the
institutions of Highgate: the most modern is the cemetery, which
was consecrated by the Lord Bishop of London in May, 1839, and
has therefore the merit of being one of the first, as it is
undoubtedly one of the most beautiful in situation, of any near
London.&nbsp; It contains about twenty acres of ground on the
side of the hill facing the metropolis.&nbsp; The approach to it
through Swain&rsquo;s Lane conducts the visitor by a green lane
rising gradually to the Gothic building which forms the
entrance.&nbsp; Entering the grounds, the eye is struck by the
taste everywhere displayed.&nbsp; Broad gravel paths on either
side wind up the steep slope to the handsome new church of St.
Michael&rsquo;s, which is seen to great advantage from almost
every part of the grounds.&nbsp; An hour may be very well <!--
page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>spent here musing on the dead.&nbsp; Good and bad, rogue
and honest man, saint and sinner, here sleep side by side.&nbsp;
John Sadleir, but too well known as M.P., and chairman of the
London and County Bank, is buried here.&nbsp; Indeed all sects,
and callings, and professions, have here their representative
men.&nbsp; General Otway has one of the handsomest monuments in
the grounds.&nbsp; One of the most tasteful is that of
Lillywhite, the cricketer, erected by public subscription.&nbsp;
Wombwell, known and admired in our childish days for his
wonderful menagerie, reposes under a massive lion.&nbsp; One
grave has a marble pillar bearing a horse all saddled and
bridled.&nbsp; The inscription under commemorates the death of a
lady, and commences thus,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone, whose nerve could guide
the swiftest steed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On inquiry we found the lady was the wife of a celebrated
knacker, well skilled in the mysteries of horseflesh and the
whip.&nbsp; Holman, the blind traveller, is buried in Highgate
Cemetery, and very near him are the mortal remains of that prince
of newspaper editors and proprietors, Stephen Rintoul.&nbsp; On
the other side the cemetery is buried Bogue, the well-known
publisher of Fleet Street.&nbsp; In the Catacombs are interred
Liston, the greatest operator of his day, and Pierce Egan, a man
as famous in his way.&nbsp; It was only a few months since Sir W.
Charles Ross, the celebrated miniature painter, was buried
here.&nbsp; Frank Stone sleeps in the same cemetery, as also does
that well-remembered actress, Mrs. Warner.&nbsp; Haydn,
well-known for his Dictionary of Dates, and Gilbert &agrave; <!--
page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>Beckett, still remembered for his comic powers, are
amongst the literary men that here await the resurrection
morn.&nbsp; A fairer place in which to sleep it would be
difficult to choose, in spite of the monstrous trophies of
affectation, or ostentation, or affection all round,&mdash;in
spite of the reminiscences of Cornhill and Cheapside, suggested
by every other grave.&nbsp; As a ride, you had better pass by
monuments unlooked at, they do but enumerate the virtues of the
illustrious obscure, and the wealth of their survivors.</p>
<p>Of the past we now recall another relic, Lord Byron, in
&ldquo;Childe Harold,&rdquo; writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some o&rsquo;er thy Thamis row the
ribbon&rsquo;d fair,<br />
Others along the safer turnpike fly;<br />
Some Richmond-hill ascend, some scud to Ware,<br />
And many to the steep of Highgate hie.<br />
Ask ye, B&oelig;otian shades! the reason why?<br />
&rsquo;Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,<br />
Grasped in the holy hand of Mystery,<br />
In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,<br />
And consecrate the oath with draught, and dance till
mom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the note from whence the above extract is taken, Lord Byron
says he alludes to a ridiculous custom which formerly prevailed
in Highgate of administering a burlesque oath to all travellers
of the middling rank who stopped there.&nbsp; The party was sworn
on a pair of horns fastened, never to kiss the maid when he could
the mistress; never to eat brown bread when he could get white;
never to drink small beer when he could get <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>strong; with
many other injunctions of the kind, to all which was added the
saving clause, &ldquo;unless you like it best.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lambert tells us, &ldquo;the oath formerly was tendered to every
person stopping at any of the public-houses of the village, which
are very numerous, and mostly distinguished by a large pair of
horns placed over the signs.&rdquo;&nbsp; I need not add, no
horns are seen now.&nbsp; When a person consented to be sworn, he
laid his hand on a pair of horns fixed to a long staff, and the
oath was administered.&nbsp; This ridiculous ceremony being over,
the juror was to kiss the horns and pay a shilling for the oath,
to be spent among the company to which he or she belonged.&nbsp;
To complete the incongruous character of the ceremony, the
father, for such was the style of the person administering the
oath, officiated in a wig and gown, with the addition of a
mask.&nbsp; The origin of this custom is completely lost, but it
was so common at one time, that one man is said to have sworn one
hundred and fifty in a day.&nbsp; It appears to have been the
fashion to make up parties to Highgate for the purpose of taking
the oath, and as a prerequisite for admission to certain
convivial societies now no more, the freedom of Highgate was
indispensable.&nbsp; The father facetiously said if the son, as
the individual sworn was termed, was too poor to pay for wine
himself, he was recommended to call for it at the first inn, and
to place it to his father&rsquo;s score, &ldquo;and now, my good
son,&rdquo; the formula continued, &ldquo;I wish you a safe
journey through Highgate and this life.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the <!--
page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>father&rsquo;s good wishes were realized, one is almost
inclined to regret that the ceremony exists no longer.&nbsp;
Another ancient institution is the grammar school, founded in
1562 by Sir Roger Cholmeley, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer,
and after that Chief Justice of the King&rsquo;s Bench.</p>
<p>But we must leave Highgate, now the retreat of the wealthy
citizen, and the great North Road, along which coaches galloped
almost every minute, and along which lords and ladies posted, ere
that frightful leveller, the railroad had been formed.&nbsp; By
the Favourite omnibuses it is but a sixpenny ride to Highgate
from the Bank, but in the good old times, the fare by the stage
was half-a-crown.&nbsp; It would do aldermen good to go up its
hill, and the city clerk or shopman cannot frequent it too
much.&nbsp; Highgate has much the air of a provincial town.&nbsp;
It has its Literary Institution, and its police office, and
water-works, and gas, its seminaries for ingenious youth of
either sex, and its shops filled with miscellaneous wares.&nbsp;
The great city is creeping up the hill, and seeking to encircle
it with its chains of brick, but it resists lustily, and with its
quaint old houses, and fine old trees, will not assume a cockney
appearance.&nbsp; I honour it for its obstinacy, and trust that
it will be long before it shall have the wicked, busy, towny
appearance of the Modern Babylon.</p>
<h2><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
TOM TIDDLER&rsquo;S GROUND.</h2>
<p>Barry Cornwall tells us that when he was a little boy he was
told that the streets of London were all paved with gold; and it
must be admitted that, to the youthful mind in general, the
metropolis is a sort of Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground, where gold
and silver are to be picked up in handfuls any day.&nbsp; There
is a good deal of exaggeration in this, undoubtedly.&nbsp; To
many, London is dark and dismal as one of its own fogs, cold and
stony as one of its own streets.&nbsp; The Earl of Shaftesbury, a
few years back, calculated there were 30,000 ragged, houseless,
homeless children in our streets.&nbsp; The number of persons who
died last year in the streets of London, from want of the
necessaries of life, would shock a Christian.&nbsp; Last year the
total number of casual destitute paupers admitted into the
workhouses of the metropolitan districts amounted to 53,221
males, 62,622 females, and 25,710 children.&nbsp; We cannot
wonder at this when we remember that it is said 60,000 persons
rise every morning utterly ignorant as to the wherewithal to feed
and maintain themselves <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>for the day.&nbsp; Wonderful are the
shifts, and efforts, and ingenuities of this class.&nbsp; One
summer-day, a lady-friend of the writer was driving in one of the
pleasant green lanes of Hornsey, when she saw a poor woman
gathering the broad leaves of the horse-chestnut.&nbsp; She asked
her why she did so.&nbsp; The reply was that she got a living by
selling them to the fruiterers in Covent Garden, who lined the
baskets with them in which they placed their choicest
specimens.&nbsp; One day it came out in evidence at a
police-court, that a mother and her children earned a scanty
subsistence by rising early in the morning, or rather late at
night, and tearing down and selling as waste-paper, the broad
sheets and placards with which the dead walls and boardings of
our metropolis abound.&nbsp; The poor sick needlewomen, stitching
for two-and-six-pence a-week, indicate in some quarters how hard
is the London struggle for life.&nbsp; But one of the worst
sights, I think, is that of women (a dozen may be seen at a
time), all black and grimy, sifting the cinders and rubbish
collected by the dustmen from various parts, and shot into one
enormous heap.</p>
<p>The last dodge exposed for making money is amusing.&nbsp; A
writer in the <i>Times</i> wanted to know how it was we see
advertisements in London papers for a million of
postage-stamps.&nbsp; A writer in reply says all the stories
about severe papas, who will not let their daughters marry till
they have papered a room with them, are false.&nbsp; He says if
the reader will go to some of the purlieus of the Borough
(leaving his watch and purse at home) he will <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>very possibly
be enlightened.&nbsp; He will be accosted by a hook-nosed man,
who will pull out a greasy pocket-book, and produce some
apparently new postage-stamps, not all joined together, but each
one separate, and will offer them for sale at about 2d. a
dozen.&nbsp; If the enterprising stranger looks very closely,
indeed, into these stamps, he may perhaps detect a slight join in
the middle.&nbsp; They are made by taking the halves which are
unobliterated of two old stamps and joining them, regumming the
backs and cleaning the faces.&nbsp; This practice is, it is said,
carried on to a great extent, in the low neighbourhoods of
Ratcliff-highway, and the Borough.</p>
<p>During the year 1858 it appears 10,004 persons died in the
public institutions of London: 5,535 in the workhouses, 57 in the
prisons, and 4,412 in hospitals.&nbsp; Of the latter number 317
belong to the Greenwich and the Chelsea hospitals, 211 to the
military and naval hospitals.&nbsp; About one in six of the
inhabitants of the metropolis dies in the public institutions,
nearly one in eleven dies in the workhouses.&nbsp; Only think of
the population of London.&nbsp; In 1857 that was estimated by the
Registrar-General at 2,800,000; since then the population has
gone on steadily increasing, and it may be fairly estimated that
the London of to-day is more than equal to three Londons of
1801.&nbsp; Now, amidst this teeming population, what thousands
of vicious, and rogues, and fools there must be; what thousands
suddenly reduced from affluence to poverty; what thousands
plunged into distress by sickness or the loss of friends, and
parents, and other benefactors; to <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>such what a
place of pain, and daily mortification, and trial London must
be!</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, from the time of Whittington and his
cat, London has abounded with instances showing how, by industry
and intelligence, and&mdash;let us trust&mdash;honesty, the
poorest may rise to the possession of great wealth and
honour.&nbsp; Indeed all the great city houses abound with
examples.&nbsp; Poor lads have come up to town, friendless and
moneyless, have been sober and steady, and firm against London
allurements and vices, have improved the abilities and
opportunities God has given them, and are now men of note and
mark.&nbsp; The late Lord Mayor was but an office-lad in the firm
of which he is now the head.&nbsp; Mr. Herbert Ingram, M.P. for
Boston, and proprietor of the <i>Illustrated News</i>, blackened
the shoes of one of his constituents.&nbsp; Mr. Anderson, of the
Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and formerly M.P. for the
Orkneys, rose in a similar manner.&nbsp; Sir Peter Laurie was
originally in a humble position in life, so was Mr. Dillon, of
the house of Dillon and Co.&nbsp; Our great Lord Chancellor, when
employment was scarce and money ditto, held a post as reporter
and theatrical critic on the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>
newspaper.&nbsp; Mr. Chaplin, the late Salisbury M.P., was an
extraordinary instance of a man rising from the humblest
rank.&nbsp; Before railways were in operation Mr. Chaplin had
succeeded in making himself one of the largest coach proprietors
in the kingdom.&nbsp; His establishment, from small beginnings,
grew till, just <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>before the opening of the London and
North Western line, he was proprietor of sixty-four
stage-coaches, worked by fifteen hundred horses, and giving
yearly returns of more than half a million sterling.&nbsp; Mr.
Cobden began life in a very subordinate position in a London
warehouse.&nbsp; Sir William Cubitt when a lad worked at his
father&rsquo;s flour-mill.&nbsp; Michael Faraday, England&rsquo;s
most eminent chemist, was the son of a poor blacksmith.&nbsp; Sir
Samuel Morton Peto worked for seven years as a carpenter,
bricklayer, and mason, under his uncle, Mr. Henry Peto.&nbsp; The
well-known Mr. Lindsay, M.P. for Sunderland, was a cabin
boy.&nbsp; The editor of one morning paper rose quite from the
ranks, and the editor of another well known journal used to be an
errand-boy in the office before, by gigantic industry and
perseverance, he attained his present high position.&nbsp; Mr. J.
Fox, the eloquent M.P. for Oldham, and the
&ldquo;Publicola&rdquo; of the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>, worked in
a Norwich factory.&nbsp; The great warehouses in Cheapside and
Cannon-street, and elsewhere, are owned by men who mostly began
life without a rap.&nbsp; Go to the beautiful villas at Norwood,
at Highgate, at Richmond, and ask who lives there, and you will
find that they are inhabited by men whose wealth is enormous, and
whose career has been a marvellous success.&nbsp; Fortunes in
London are made by trifles.&nbsp; I know a man who keeps a
knacker&rsquo;s yard, who lives out of town in a villa of
exquisite beauty, and who drives horses which a prince might
envy.&nbsp; Out of the profits of his vegetable pills <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>Morrison bought himself a nice estate.&nbsp; Mrs.
Holloway drives one of the handsomest carriages you shall meet in
the Strand.&nbsp; Sawyer and Strange, who the other day were
respectable young men unknown to fame, paid the Crystal Palace
Company upwards of &pound;12,000, as per contract, for the
liberty to supply refreshments for a few months.&nbsp; In the
city there, at this time, may be seen the proprietor of a
dining-room, who drives a handsome mail-phaeton and pair daily to
town in the morning to do business, and back at night.&nbsp;
Thackeray has a tale of a gentleman who married a young lady,
drove his cab, and lived altogether in great style.&nbsp; The
gentleman was very silent as to his occupation; he would not even
communicate the secret to his wife.&nbsp; All that she knew was
what was patent to all his neighbours&mdash;that he went in his
Brougham in the morning, and returned at night.&nbsp; Even the
mother-in-law, prying as she was, was unable to solve the
mystery.&nbsp; At length, one day the unfortunate wife, going
with her dear mamma into the city, in the person of a street
sweeper clothed in rags, and covered with dirt, she recognised
her lord and master, who decamped and was never heard of
more.&nbsp; The story is comic, but not improbable, for London is
so full of wealth, you have only to take your place, and it seems
as if some of the golden shower must fall into your mouth.&nbsp;
Mr. Thwaites, when examined before the Parliamentary Committee on
the Embankment of the Thames, said, &ldquo;The metropolis
contributes very largely to the taxation of the country.&nbsp;
<!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>The value of the property assessed under Schedule A, is
&pound;22,385,350, whilst the sum for the rest of the kingdom is
&pound;127,994,288; under Schedule D the metropolis shows
&pound;37,871,644, against &pound;86,077,676.&nbsp; The gross
estimated rental of the property of the metropolis assessed to
the poor rates is &pound;16,157,320, against &pound;86,077,676
from the rest of the kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; The speculations on
the Stock Exchange embrace a national debt of 800 millions,
railway shares to the extent of 300 millions, besides foreign
stock, foreign railway shares, and miscellaneous investments of
all kinds.&nbsp; Land has been sold in the neighbourhood of the
Exchange and the Bank at the rate of a million pounds an
acre.&nbsp; The rateable value of the property assessed to the
poor rates in the districts of the metropolis in 1857 amounted to
&pound;11,167,678.&nbsp; A Parliamentary Return shows that the
total ordinary receipts of the Corporation of the city for the
year 1857 amounted to &pound;905,298, the largest item being the
coal duty, &pound;64,238.&nbsp; The London omnibuses pay
government a duty of no less than &pound;70,200 a year.&nbsp; The
Thames even, dirty and stinking as it is, is full of gold.&nbsp;
One fact will place its commercial value in the clearest
light.&nbsp; In 1856 the Customs&rsquo; duties entered as
collected from all parts of the United Kingdom were
&pound;19,813,622, and of this large sum considerably more than
half was collected in the port of London,&mdash;the
Customs&rsquo; duties paid in the port of London alone being
&pound;12,287,591, a much larger sum than paid by all the
remaining ports of the United Kingdom put together.&nbsp; No
wonder that the <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Londoners are proud of the
Thames.&nbsp; Why, even the very mudlarks&mdash;the boys who
prowl in its mud on behalf of treasure-trove&mdash;earn, it is
said, as much as &pound;2,000 to &pound;3,000 by that miserable
employment in the course of a year.</p>
<p>But we stop.&nbsp; The magnitude of Loudon wealth and even
crime can never be fully estimated.&nbsp; It is a boundless
ocean, in which the brave, sturdy, steady swimmer&mdash;while the
weak are borne away rapidly to destruction&mdash;may pick up
precious pearls.</p>

WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</h2>
<p>On Monday, Jan. 9, 1860, we formed part of a crowd who had
assembled in the Poet&rsquo;s Corner, Westminster Abbey, to view
the burial of the only man of our generation who, by means of his
literary and oratorical efforts, has won for his brow a
coronet.&nbsp; Of Babington Macaulay, as essayist, poet, orator,
historian, statesman, we need not speak.&nbsp; What he was, and
what he did, are patent to all the world.&nbsp; Born in 1800, the
son of Zachary Macaulay, one of the brilliant band of
anti-slavery agitators of which Mr. Wilberforce was the head,
young Babington commenced life under favourable
circumstances.&nbsp; At Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was
educated, the world first heard of his wondrous talent.&nbsp; In
1830 he was returned by Lord Lansdowne for his borough of Calne;
the Reform agitation was then at its height, and how bitterly,
and fiercely, and eloquently Macaulay spoke we remember at this
day.&nbsp; Then, in 1834, commenced his Indian exile, at the end
of which he returned to Parliament with a competency.&nbsp; <!--
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>His Essays in the Edinburgh Review and his History were
the chief business of his life.&nbsp; He might have shone as a
poet had he not betaken himself to prose; but in this department
he remained unrivalled, and the result was riches and fame.&nbsp;
On one occasion, it is said, his publisher gave him a cheque for
&pound;20,000, and he was made by the Whigs a peer.&nbsp; His
burial at Westminster Abbey, at the foot of Addison, was a
fitting climax to his career of wondrous achievement and gorgeous
success.&nbsp; Men most distinguished in literature&mdash;in
science&mdash;in law&mdash;in statesmanship&mdash;in
divinity&mdash;in rank&mdash;were present.&nbsp; The funeral was
not as touching as might have been expected.&nbsp; It may be that
the choral service itself interferes with the inner feeling of
sadness the death of such a man arouses in every mind; it may be
that the human voice is inadequate to express the power, and
pathos, and majesty of the form of words used on such occasions;
and it is certain that the many ladies present were dressed in
the most unbefitting costumes, and that ribbons, and bonnets, and
dresses of all the colours of the rainbow were quite out of
keeping with the place and the occasion.&nbsp; The saddest sight,
the one most suggestive of deep feeling, was that of one or two
ladies, high up in a recess above the grave.&nbsp; They were real
mourners.&nbsp; Indeed, it was said one of them was the sister of
the deceased peer.&nbsp; Lord John Russell also exhibited an
emotion for which the general public will scarce give him
credit.&nbsp; At the grave he was so much overcome, that it
seemed as if he would have fallen had <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>not the Duke
of Argyle held him up.&nbsp; Well might his Lordship be moved to
tears.&nbsp; Could he keep from thinking, while standing there,
how soon his own turn would come, and how well and worthily he,
who slept the sleep of death in the plain coffin at his feet, had
fought the battle of the Whigs in their palmy days?&nbsp; We
looked back, as we stood there, to other days.&nbsp; We saw a
theatre in Gower Street filled with intelligent youths.&nbsp; A
winter session had been closed: all its work and competition were
over; to the successful candidates prizes were to be
awarded.&nbsp; The fathers and mothers, the friends and sisters
of such had come together from far and near.&nbsp; Seated in a
chair was a stout, mild, genial man, with face somewhat pale, and
hair scant and inclined to grey.&nbsp; He rose, and was received
with rapturous applause; he spoke in plain language&mdash;with
little action, with a voice rather inclined to be harsh&mdash;of
the bright future which rises before the rapt eye of youth.&nbsp;
He spoke&mdash;and as he did so, as he mounted from one climax to
another, every young heart filled and warmed with the
speaker&rsquo;s theme.&nbsp; That was Macaulay, just come from
India, with an honourable competence, to consummate the fame as a
man he had acquired in younger years.&nbsp; Again, we thought of
that last speech in the House of Commons, when, at an early hour
on a beautiful summer evening, the Parks, and Clubs, and Rotten
Row had been deserted, for it had gone forth to the world that
Macaulay was about to speak.&nbsp; Poor Joseph Hume had moved the
adjournment of the debate, <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>and, as a
matter of right, was in possession of the House; but the calls
for Macaulay on all sides were so numerous, that even that most
good-natured of men, as Hume was, grew a little angry and
remonstrated; but it was in vain that he sought the attention of
the House: all were anxious for the next speaker, and no sooner
had Hume sat down than Macaulay delivered, in his hurried
feverish way, one of those speeches which not merely delight, but
which influence men&rsquo;s votes and opinions, and may be read
with delight when the occasion which gave rise to them has long
since passed away.&nbsp; We have heard much in favour of
competition in the civil service, at home and in India, since
then, but never was the argument more clearly put&mdash;more
copiously illustrated, more clothed in grace and beauty; and then
came a few short years of infirmity of body, of labour with the
pen, and sudden death, and the burial at Westminster Abbey.&nbsp;
Out of the thousands standing by the grave, few could ever expect
to see the career of such another genius.&nbsp; He is gone, and
we may not hope to see his work finished.&nbsp; In vain we call
up him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who left untold,<br />
The story of Cambuscan bold.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then another public funeral has taken place in
Westminster Abbey; only the other day we saw deposited there the
ashes of Sir Charles Barry, and here, as year by year passes over
our heads, richer, and dearer, and wider are the associations
which cluster around that venerable pile.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
envy the man who can point a <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>sneer at
Westminster Abbey; how placid and beautiful is the outside, how
eloquently it speaks to the ambitious lawyer, the busy merchant,
the statesman bent on fame, the beauty armed for conquest; what a
testimony it bears to the religious spirit of the age which
witnessed its erection, and of the brain or brains which
conceived its magnificent design.</p>
<p>The Abbey is open to public inspection between the hours of
eleven and three daily, and also in the summer months between
four and six in the afternoon.&nbsp; The public are not admitted
to view the monuments on Good Friday, Christmas Day, or fast
days, or during the hours of Divine Service.&nbsp; The nave,
transept, and cloisters are entirely free.&nbsp; The charge for
admission to the rest of the Abbey, through which you are
accompanied by a guide, is sixpence each person.&nbsp; The
entrance is at the south transept, better known as Poet&rsquo;s
Corner.&nbsp; It will do you good to walk in there any Sunday
during Divine Service.&nbsp; The appearance of the place is
singularly striking.&nbsp; The white-robed choristers; the
benches filled with well-dressed people the dark religious
columns; the lofty and fretted roof; the marble monuments and
busts looking down on you from every wall and corner; the gleams
of mellow sunlight streaming in from richly painted
windows&mdash;all tend to produce an effect such as you can find
nowhere else&mdash;an effect of which you must be sensible if you
care not for the rich notes of the organ, or sleep while the
parson preaches.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>The Abbey, originally a Benedictine monastery&mdash;the
Minster west of St. Paul&rsquo;s London&mdash;was founded
originally in what was called Thorney Island, by Sebert, King of
the East Saxons, 616.&nbsp; The patron Saint, Peter himself, is
said to have consecrated it by night, and in a most miraculous
manner.&nbsp; Till the time of Edward the Confessor the Abbey
does not seem to have made much way; but the meek-minded Prince
was led to give the Abbey a patronage which led to the building
becoming what it is.&nbsp; It seems the Prince had been ill, and
vowed to take a journey to the Holy Land if he should
recover.&nbsp; But, as often is the case with vows made in
sickness, the Prince, when well, found it exceedingly
inconvenient to fulfil his vow.&nbsp; The only course left for
him was to appeal to the Pope.&nbsp; The Holy Father, of course,
was appealed to, and freed the pious king from his vow on one
condition&mdash;that he should spend the money that the journey
would have cost him in some religious building.&nbsp; The Prince,
too happy to be freed from the consequences of this foolish vow,
gladly promised to do so; and, whilst he was considering as to
what building he should favour with his royal patronage, one of
the monks of Westminster&mdash;rather an artful man, we
imagine&mdash;was reported to have had a wonderful dream, in
which no less a personage than St. Peter himself appeared to him,
and charged him to take a message to the King, to the effect that
his celestial saintship hoped he would not overlook the claims of
Westminster.&nbsp; Of course, to so pious a prince as Edward,
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>the saintly wish was law; and on Westminster were
lavished the most princely sums.&nbsp; Succeeding kings followed
in the same steps.&nbsp; Henry III. and his son, Edward I.,
rebuilt it nearly as we see it now.&nbsp; It is difficult to say
what the building must have cost its royal patrons.&nbsp; In our
own time, its repairs have amounted to an enormous sum.</p>
<p>As the last resting place of the great, Westminster Abbey must
always be dear to Englishmen.&nbsp; It was a peerage or
Westminster Abbey that urged Nelson on.&nbsp; Old Godfrey Kneller
did not rate the honour of lying in Westminster Abbey quite so
highly.&nbsp; &ldquo;By God,&rdquo; exclaimed the old painter,
&ldquo;I will not be buried in Westminster!&nbsp; They do bury
fools there.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is difficult to say on what
principle the burials there take place.&nbsp; Byron&rsquo;s
monument was refused, though Thorwaldsen was the sculptor; and
yet Prior has a staring one to himself&mdash;that Prior whose
Chloe was an alehouse drab, and who was as far inferior to Byron
in genius as a farthing rushlight to the morning star.</p>
<p>Another evil, to which public attention should be drawn, is
the expense attending a funeral there.&nbsp; When Tom Campbell
(would that he were alive to write war lyrics now!) was buried,
the fees to the Dean and Chapter amounted to somewhere between
five and six hundred pounds.&nbsp; Surely it ought not to be
so.&nbsp; The Dean and Chapter are well paid enough as it is.</p>
<p>If, reader, pausing on the hallowed ground, you feel inclined
to think of the past, remember that beneath you <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>sleep many
English statesmen,&mdash;Clarendon, the great Lord Chatham, Pitt,
Fox, and Canning; that there</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mighty chiefs sleep side by side.<br />
Drop upon Fox&rsquo;s grave the tear,<br />
&rsquo;Twill trickle to his rival&rsquo;s bier.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bacon
there<br />
Gives more than female beauty to a stone,<br />
And Chatham, eloquence to marble life;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that of poets; Chaucer, Spenser, Ben Jonson, Dryden, Congreve,
Addison, Sheridan, and Campbell, and others, there await the
sound of the last trumpet; that old Sam Johnson there finds rest;
that there the brain of a Newton has crumbled into dust; and, as
if to shew that all distinctions are levelled by death, Mrs.
Oldfield, Mrs. Bracegirdle, and other favourites of the stage,
are buried there.&nbsp; As a burial place Westminster Abbey
resembles the world.&nbsp; We jostle one another precisely so in
real life.&nbsp; &ldquo;The age is grown so picked, that the toe
of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls
his kibe.&rdquo;</p>

LONDON CHARITIES.</h2>
<p>When Guizot visited London the principal thing that struck him
was the nature and the extent of London Charities.&nbsp;
Undoubtedly the English are a more charitable people than the
French.&nbsp; When the ruinously low prices of the Funds forbade
a loan, the loyalty-loan brought forth the name of a Lancashire
cotton-spinner, the father of the lamented statesman, Sir Robert
Peel, who subscribed &pound;60,000; and when George the Third
sent the Minister Pitt to compliment him on this truly loyal and
patriotic subscription, he simply replied that another
&pound;60,000 would be forthcoming if it was wanted for the
defence of the country.&nbsp; Did Napoleon, or any French
monarch, ever possess such a patriotic subject?&nbsp; The spirit
is still the same.&nbsp; What sums the nation subscribed for the
relief of the wives and widows and orphans of the Crimean
heroes.&nbsp; What an amount was raised at once for the victims
of the Indian mutiny.&nbsp; An Englishman likes to make money,
and makes many a sacrifice to do it; but then how lavishly and
with what <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>a princely hand he gives it.&nbsp;
And in this respect the Londoner is a thorough
Englishman&mdash;his charity covers a multitude of sins.&nbsp; I
am aware some of this charity is of a doubtful character.&nbsp; A
draper, for instance, may subscribe to the funds&mdash;of such an
institution as that for early closing&mdash;a very handsome sum,
merely as a good business advertisement; other tradesmen may and
undoubtedly do the same.&nbsp; There is also a spirit of rivalry
in these matters&mdash;if Smith saw Jones&rsquo; name down for
&pound;50, he, thinking he was as good as Smith any day, and
perhaps a good deal better, puts his name down for
&pound;100.&nbsp; Somehow or other we can scarce do good things
without introducing a little of the alloy of poor human nature;
but London charities undoubtedly cover a multitude of sins.</p>
<p>Associations for the voluntary relief of distress, the
reclamation of the criminal, and diffusion of Christian truth,
are a noble characteristic of the English people.&nbsp; There is
no city in the world possessing an equal number of charitable
institutions to those of the British capital.&nbsp; Taking the
whole of London, and not exempting, from their distance, such as
may be correctly classed as metropolitan institutions, as
Greenwich Hospital, &amp;c., we find there are no less than 526
charitable institutions, exclusive of mere local endowments and
trusts, parochial and local schools, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These charities annually disburse in aid of their respective
objects the extraordinary amount of &pound;1,764,733, of which
upwards of &pound;1,000,000 is raised annually by voluntary
contributions; the remainder from funded property, sale of
publications, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The facility with which money can be raised in London <!--
page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>for charitable purposes is very astonishing.&nbsp; A
short time back it was announced that the London Hospital had
lost about &pound;1,500 a year by the falling in of
annuities.&nbsp; It was, therefore, necessary, if the Hospital
was to continue its charities to the same extent as heretofore,
that additional funds should be raised.&nbsp; In an incredibly
short space of time &pound;24,000 were collected.&nbsp; The
<i>Times</i> makes an appeal about Christmas time for the refuges
of the destitute in the metropolis, and generally it raises
somewhere about &pound;10,000&mdash;a nice addition to the
regular income of the societies.&nbsp; The Bishop of London,
since he has been connected with his diocese, has consecrated 29
new churches, accommodating 90,000 persons, erected by voluntary
subscriptions.&nbsp; We may depend upon it the various sects of
dissenters are equally active in their way.&nbsp; During last
year the Field Lane Refuge supplied 30,302 lodgings to 6,785 men
and boys, who received 101,193 either six or eight ounce loaves
of bread.&nbsp; At the same time 840 women were admitted during
the year, to whom were supplied 10,028 lodgings, averaging 11
nights shelter to each person, by whom 14,755 loaves were
consumed.&nbsp; On the whole it appears that 10,000 persons
annually participate in the advantages of this institution, and
1,222 of the most forlorn and wretched creatures in London were
taken from the streets and placed in a position where they might
earn their own bread, and all this at the cost of 3s. 6d. each
per annum.&nbsp; In 1851 the original Shoeblack Society sent five
boys into the street to get an honest <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>living by
cleaning boots rather than by picking and stealing, and now their
number is about 350.&nbsp; Mr. Mayhew calculates the London
charities at three millions and a half per annum.&nbsp; In
estimating London charities we must not be unmindful of those
required by law.&nbsp; According to a return published a couple
of years since, I find, in the districts of the metropolis, the
average amount expended for the relief of the poor was 1s.
6&frac34;d. in the pound.&nbsp; The total number of casual
destitute paupers admitted into the workhouses of the
metropolitan districts during the year amounted to 53,221 males,
62,622 females, and 25,716 children.&nbsp; The quantity of food
supplied to these paupers varies much in the several districts,
as also the nature of the work required.&nbsp; In some cases no
work at all is exacted from the casual poor, but where it is, the
demand appears to be chiefly for picking oakum and breaking
stones.&nbsp; In some cases the dietary includes bread and
cheese, with gruel, and sometimes even the luxury of butter is
added.&nbsp; In other cases bread and water (very meagre fare,
and insufficient to support life for any length of time), are all
that is allowed.&nbsp; Women suckling infants are supplied tea,
broth, or gruel in lieu of water; we can scarce wonder the poor
prefer going to jail.&nbsp; I have seen in jails, and convict
establishments, dinners better served than are earned even by
many of the industrious poor.&nbsp; I find during the last year
the 339 agents of the London City Mission had paid 1,528,162
visits during the year; 117,443 of these visits being <!-- page
81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>to
the sick and dying.&nbsp; By their means a large number of Bibles
and Tracts had been distributed, 11,200 children had been sent to
school, and 580 fallen females restored to virtue.&nbsp; At the
annual meeting of the Ragged School Union it was stated that in
170 Ragged School institutions, there were 199 Sunday Schools,
with 24,860 scholars; 146 day schools with 15,380 scholars, and
215 evening schools, with 9,050 scholars: of teachers 400 were
paid, and 9,690 were voluntary.&nbsp; There were fifteen refuges
in which 600 inmates were fed, lodged, clothed, and
educated.&nbsp; The midnight meeting movement, of which we have
heard so much, and respecting which opinions so much differ,
according to its report, has been very successful; through the
instrumentality of the committee seven meetings had been called;
1700 women had been addressed; 7500 scriptural cards and books
had been circulated; and 107 had been reclaimed and placed in
homes, through the agency of which, they would, it was hoped, be
restored to society.&nbsp; In addition to these five had been
restored to their friends, one to her husband, two placed in
situations, and one had been married.&nbsp; In the general
charities of England London has its share.&nbsp; It not merely
takes the initiative but it subscribes by far the larger
part.&nbsp; When the Crimean war broke out a fund was raised for
the wives and families of the soldiers engaged in it, amounting
to &pound;121,139; &pound;260,000 were subscribed for the relief
of the victims of the Indian mutiny.&nbsp; Well it was in <!--
page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>London that the most liberal donations were made.&nbsp;
Again, look at the Religious Societies.&nbsp; In last year the
income of the Church Missionary Society was &pound;163,629. 1s.
4d.; of the Bible Society &pound;162,020. 13s. 5d.&nbsp; Of the
Wesleyan Missionary Society, &pound;141,000. 5s. 11d.&nbsp; Of
the London Missionary Society, &pound;93,000.&nbsp; Thus gigantic
and all-persuading are the charities of London.&nbsp; The
almshouses erected by private individuals or public subscriptions
are too numerous to be described, except we refer to the London
Almshouses erected at Brixton to commemorate the passing of the
Reform Bill; nor would I forget the Charter House with its jovial
and grateful chorus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then blessed be the memory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of good old Thomas Sutton,<br />
Who gave us lodging, learning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he gave us beef and mutton.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, with its annual income of
&pound;50,000; nor the Foundling Hospital, with its 500 children;
nor Alleyn&rsquo;s magnificent gift of Dulwich; nor the Bethlehem
Hospital, with its income of nearly &pound;30,000 a year; nor the
Magdalene.&nbsp; But we must say a few words about the Hospitals;
of the more than 500 Charitable Institutions of the metropolis,
one quarter consists of general medical hospitals, medical
charities for special purposes, dispensaries, &amp;c.&nbsp; In
1859, in Bartholomew&rsquo;s, I find there were patients
admitted, cured, and discharged, 5,865 in, 86,480 out; <!-- page
83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>in
St. Thomas&rsquo;s 4,114 in, 44,744 out; the Charing Cross
Hospital has, I believe, on an average 1,000 inpatients, 17,000
out.&nbsp; Guy&rsquo;s, with its annual income of &pound;30,000,
has an entire average of in and outpatients of 50,000.&nbsp; But
we stop, the list is not exhausted, but we fear the patience of
the reader is.</p>

PEDESTRIANISM.</h2>
<p>I am a great advocate of Pedestrianism, and take it to be a
very honest way of getting through the world.&nbsp; If you ride
in a carriage you may be upset; if you throw your leg across a
horse&rsquo;s back you may meet with the fate of Sir Robert Peel;
and as to getting into a railway carriage, the fearful
consequences of that require for their description a more
vigorous pen than mine.&nbsp; I like to see a good walker; how
delightful his appetite, how firm his muscle, how healthy his
cheek, how splendid his condition.&nbsp; Has he a care, he walks
it off; is ruin staring him in the face, only let him have a
couple of hour&rsquo;s walk, and he is in a condition to meet the
great enemy of mankind himself.&nbsp; Has his friend betrayed
him&mdash;are his hopes of fame, of wealth, of power
blighted?&mdash;is his love&rsquo;s young dream rudely
broken?&nbsp; Let him away from the circles of men out on the
green turf, with the blue sky of heaven above, and in a very
little while the agony is over, and &ldquo;Richard&rsquo;s
himself again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Were it only for the sake of the
active exercise it inculcates <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>and requires
I would say&mdash;Long live the Rifle Corps movement.&nbsp; The
other day a gallant little band in my own immediate neighbourhood
set out for an evening&rsquo;s march.&nbsp; They were in capital
spirits; they were dressed in their Sunday best; they had a band
playing at their head; a miscellaneous crowd, chiefly juvenile,
with a few occasional females behind, brought up the rear.&nbsp;
A deputy of the London Corporation and his brother formed part of
the devoted troop.&nbsp; Gaily and amidst cheers they marched
from the bosoms of their families, leaving &ldquo;their girls
behind them.&rdquo;&nbsp; On they went, up-hill and down-hill,
many a mile, amidst Hornsey&rsquo;s pleasant green lanes, till at
length the London deputy turned pale, and intimated&mdash;while
his limbs appeared to sink beneath him, and his whole body was
bathed in sweat&mdash;that he could stand it no longer.&nbsp; The
spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak.&nbsp; A halt was
ordered&mdash;beer was sought for for the London deputy, and with
considerable difficulty they got the martial hero home.&nbsp; Had
that gallant man been a good pedestrian, would he not have
scorned the beer, and laughed at the idea of rest?&nbsp; Look at
Charles Dickens&mdash;I am sure he will forgive me the
personality, as no harm is intended&mdash;why is he ever genial,
ever fresh&mdash;as superior to the crowd who imitate his
mannerism, but fail to catch his warm, sunny, human spirit, as
the Koh-i-noor to its glass counterfeit, but because no man in
town walks more than he?&nbsp; What a man for walking was the
great Liston, foremost operator of his age.&nbsp; The late Lord
Suffield, who fought all <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>the Lords,
including the bench of Bishops, in order to win emancipation for
the slave, was one of the most athletic men of his day.&nbsp; On
one occasion he ran a distance of ten miles before the Norwich
mail as a casual frolic, without any previous training, and he
assured Sir George Stephen that he never experienced any
inconvenience from it.&nbsp; When we talk of a man being weak on
his pins, what does it imply but that he has been a rake, or a
sot, or a fool who has cultivated the pocket or the brain at the
expense of that machine, so fearfully and wonderfully made, we
call man.&nbsp; The machine is made to wear well, it is
man&rsquo;s fault if it does not.&nbsp; The pedestrian alone
keeps his in good repair; our long livers have mostly been great
walkers.&nbsp; Taylor, the water-poet, says of old
Parr&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Good wholesome labour was his exercise,<br
/>
Down with the lamb, and with the lark would rise,<br />
In mire and toiling sweat he spent the day,<br />
And to his team he whistled time away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People are getting more fond of physical exercise than they
were.&nbsp; We may almost ask&mdash;Are we returned back to the
days of the Iliad and the Odyssey?&nbsp; The gentlemen of the
Stock Exchange greet Tom Sayers as if he were an emperor, and, it
is said, peers and clergymen think it right to assist at a
&ldquo;mill.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have heard so much about muscular
Christianity&mdash;so much stress has been laid upon the
adjective&mdash;that we seem in danger of forgetting the
Christianity altogether.&nbsp; Undoubtedly our fathers are to
blame in some <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>respect for this.&nbsp; Good
Christians, thinking more of the next world than of this,
merchants, and tradesmen, and even poor clerks, hastening to be
rich, scholars aiming at fame, and mothers of a frugal turn, have
set themselves against out-door life and out-door fun, and have
done with sports and pastimes&mdash;as Rowland Hill said the
pious had done with the tunes&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> let the devil
have all the good ones.&nbsp; In vain you war with nature, she
will have her revenge, the heart is true to its old
instincts.&nbsp; Man is what he was when the Greek pitched his
tent by the side of the much-sounding sea, and before the walls
of Troy; when Alexander sighed for fresh worlds to conquer; when
the young Hannibal vowed deathless hate to Rome; when the rude
ballad of &ldquo;Chevy Chase,&rdquo; sung in baronial hall,
stirred men as if it were the sound of a trumpet; when Nelson
swept the seas, and when Wellington shattered the mighty hosts of
France.&nbsp; Thus is it old physical sports and pastimes never
die, and perhaps nowhere are they more encouraged and practised
than by the population of our cities and towns.</p>
<p>The other day some considerable interest was excited in the
peculiar circles given to the study of <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>,
by the fact that Jem Pudney was to run Jem Rowan for &pound;50
a-side, at the White Lion, Hackney Wick.&nbsp; The winner was to
have the Champion&rsquo;s Cup.&nbsp; Far and near had sounded and
resounded the name of Pudney the swift-footed&mdash;how he had
distanced all his competitors&mdash;how he had done eleven miles
under the hour&mdash;were facts patent to all sporting England;
but against him <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>was this melancholy reality, that he
was getting old&mdash;he was verging on thirty-two.&nbsp;
However, when, after a weary pilgrimage through mud, and sleet,
and rain, we found ourselves arrived at the classic spot.&nbsp;
The betting was very much in Pudney&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; The
race was to have commenced at five, but it did not begin before
six.&nbsp; We had plenty of time to look around.&nbsp; Outside we
had passed a motley multitude.&nbsp; There were cabs, and
Hansoms, and Whitechapel dog-carts in abundance.&nbsp; Monday is
an off-day as regards many of the operatives and mechanics of
London, and they were thronging round the door, or clambering up
the pales, or peeping through the boards, or climbing some
neighbouring height, to command a view of the race on strictly
economical principles.&nbsp; Several owners of horses and carts,
with their wives and families, were indulging in a similar
amusement; an admission fee of one shining enabled us to
penetrate the enclosure.&nbsp; We pay our money and enter.&nbsp;
The scene is not an inviting one.&nbsp; Perhaps there are about a
thousand of us present, and most of us are of a class of society
we may denominate rough and ready.&nbsp; Even the people who have
good clothes do not look like gentlemen.&nbsp; They have very
short hair, very flat and dark faces; have a tremendous
development of the lower jaw, and, while they are unnaturally
broad about the chest, seem unnaturally thin and weak as regards
their lower extremities.&nbsp; Most of the younger ones are in
good sporting condition, and would be very little distressed by a
little set-to, whether <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>of a playful or a business nature,
and could bear an amount of punishment which would be fatal to
the writer of this article, and, I dare say, to the reader as
well.&nbsp; Time passes slowly.&nbsp; Jones hails Brown, and
offers him seven to four.&nbsp; (After the race had terminated, I
saw Jones cash up a &pound;100 fresh bank-note, which I thought
might have been more usefully invested.)&nbsp; Robinson bets
Smith what he likes that he does not name the winner; and one
gent, with an unpleasing expression of countenance, offers to do
a little business with me, which I decline, for reasons that I am
not particularly desirous to communicate to my new
acquaintance.&nbsp; I am glad to see a policeman or two present,
for one likes to know the protection of the law may be invoked in
an extremity, and I keep near its manifest and outward
sign.&nbsp; The White Lion is doing a fine business; there is an
active demand for beer and tobacco; and a gentleman who deals in
fried fish soon clears off his little stock of delicacies, as
likewise does a peripatetic vendor of sandwiches of a mysterious
origin.&nbsp; The heroes of the night slowly walk up and down the
course, wearing long great coats, beneath which we may see their
naked legs, and feet encased in light laced shoes.&nbsp; Their
backers are with them, and a crowd watches with curious
eyes.&nbsp; At length the course is cleared, a bell is rung, and
they are off.&nbsp; Six times round the course is a
mile&mdash;six times ten are sixty.&nbsp; Sixty times must they
pass and repass that excited mob.&nbsp; The favourite takes the
lead at a steady running; he maintains it some time; he is longer
than <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>his opponent, but the latter is younger, and looks more
muscular in his thighs.&nbsp; Both men, with the exception of a
cloth round the loins, are naked as when born; and as they run
they scatter the mud, which mud thus scattered descends upon them
in a by no means refreshing shower.&nbsp; As round after round is
run the excitement deepens; the favourite is greeted with cheers;
but when at the end of the third mile he is passed by his
competitor excites an enthusiasm which is intense.&nbsp; Now the
bettors tremble; the favourite attempts to get his old position;
he gains on his foe&mdash;they are now neck and neck&mdash;cheer,
boys, cheer&mdash;&ldquo;Go it, Jem!&rdquo; is the cry on many
sides.&nbsp; Jem the winner does go it; but, alas! Jem the loser
cannot.&nbsp; It is in vain he seeks the lead.&nbsp; Fortune has
declared against him, and in a little while he gives up&mdash;no
longer the swiftest and fleetest of England&rsquo;s sons&mdash;no
longer the holder of the Champion&rsquo;s Cup.&nbsp; One
involuntarily feels for fallen greatness, and as Pudney was led
away utterly beaten, I could not find it in my heart to
rejoice.&nbsp; I left a crowd still on the grounds.&nbsp; I left
Rowan still running, as he was bound to do, till he had completed
his ten miles: and I left the White Lion, in-doors and out, doing
a very considerable business.&nbsp; It seemed to me the White
Lion was not such a fool as he looked, and that he felt, let who
will win or lose, he with his beer and brandy would not come off
second best.&nbsp; This, undoubtedly, was the worst part of the
business.&nbsp; The race over, for further excitement, the
multitude would rush to the White Lion&mdash;<!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>the losers to
drown their sorrow, the winners to spend their gains; the many,
who were neither winners nor losers, merely because others did
so; and thus, as the hours pass, would come intoxication, anger,
follies, and, perhaps, bitterness of heart for life.</p>
<p>May I here enumerate the heroes of pedestrianism?&nbsp; Let me
name Robert Skipper, who walked a thousand miles in a thousand
successive half-hours&mdash;let me not forget Captain Barclay,
who walked a thousand miles in a thousand successive
hours&mdash;let me record the fame of Captain John T. G.
Campbell, of the 91st, who, accoutred in the heavy marching order
of a private soldier, on the Mallow and Fermoy road, did ten
miles in 107&frac14; minutes.&nbsp; All honour be to such! long
may their memories be green!&nbsp; Let me beg the considerate
reader not to forget West, who ran forty miles in five hours and
a half.&nbsp; Ten miles an hour is done by all the best
runners.&nbsp; It is said West accomplished 100 miles in 18
hours.&nbsp; I read in a certain work devoted to manly exercises,
&ldquo;at the rate of four miles an hour a man may walk any
length of time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writer begs to inform the reader
that he doubts this very much.</p>

92</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
OVER LONDON BRIDGE.</h2>
<p>Mr. Commissioner Harvey is particularly fond of figures.&nbsp;
The other day he caused an account to be taken of the number of
persons entering the city within a given period.&nbsp; The result
shows that the amazing number of 706,621 individuals passed into
the city by various entrances during the 24 hours tested; and as
the day selected, we are told, was free from any extraordinary
attraction to the city, there can be no doubt that the return
furnishes a fair estimate of the average daily influx.&nbsp; Of
this large number it appears only one-fourteenth, or 49,242,
entered the city in the night&mdash;that is, between the hours of
11 p.m. and 7 a.m.&nbsp; Now this enormous population in very
large numbers patronises London Bridge for many reasons&mdash;the
principle argument with them in its favour undoubtedly is, that
it is the shortest way from their homes to their places of
business, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.&nbsp; Last year, for
instance, the North London Railway carried nearly six millions of
passengers; the London and South Western more than four millions;
the <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>Blackwall nearly five millions; while 13,500,000
passengers passed through the London Bridge Station.&nbsp; Mr.
Commissioner Harvey, however, makes the importance of London
Bridge still clearer.&nbsp; On the 17th of March last year he had
a man engaged in taking notes of the traffic, and he furnished
Mr. Commissioner Harvey with the following figures:&mdash;In the
course of the twenty-four hours it appears 4,483 cabs, 4,286
omnibuses, 9,245 wagons and carts, 2,430 other vehicles, and 54
horses led or ridden, making a total of 20,498, passed over the
bridge.&nbsp; The passengers in the same period were, in vehicles
60,836, on foot 107,074, total, 167,910.&nbsp; As we may suppose
this traffic is an increasing one.&nbsp; The traffic across the
old bridge in one July day, 1811, was as follows:&mdash;89,640
persons on foot, 769 wagons, 2,924 carts and drays, 1,240
coaches, 485 gigs and taxed carts, and 764 horses.&nbsp; We must
recollect that in 1811 the bridges across the Thames were
fewer.&nbsp; There was then no Waterloo Bridge, no Hungerford
Suspension Bridge, no bridge at Southwark, no penny steamboats
running every quarter of an hour from Paul&rsquo;s Wharf to the
Surrey side, and London Bridge was far more important than
now.&nbsp; The figures we have given also throw some light on the
manners and customs of the age.&nbsp; Where are the gigs now,
then the attribute of respectability?&nbsp; What has become of
the 1,240 coaches, and what a falling off of
equestrianism&mdash;the 764 horses of 1811 have dwindled down (in
1859) to the paltry number of 54.&nbsp; Are there no night
equestrians in London <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>now.&nbsp; It is early morn and we
stand on London Bridge, green are the distant Surrey hills, clear
the blue sky, stately the public buildings far and near.&nbsp;
Beneath us what fleets in a few hours about to sail, with
passengers and merchandize to almost every continental
port.&nbsp; Surely Wordsworth&rsquo;s Ode written on Westminster
Bridge is not inapplicable:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Earth has not anything to show more
fair.<br />
Dull would he be of sense who could pass by,<br />
A sight so touching in its majesty;<br />
This city now doth like a garment wear<br />
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,<br />
Shops, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie<br />
Open unto the fields, and to the sky,<br />
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air;<br />
Never did sun more beautifully steep<br />
In his first splendour valley, arch, or hill;<br />
Ne&rsquo;er saw I, never felt a calm so deep,<br />
The river glideth at his own sweet will,<br />
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep<br />
And all that mighty heart is lying still!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the traffic by water visible from London Bridge as you look
towards Greenwich, the best idea may be gathered by a few
figures.&nbsp; A Parliamentary Return has been issued, showing
that the amount of tonnage cleared from the port of London was in
1750, 796,632 tons, in 1800 the tonnage entered was 796,632; and
that cleared was 729,554.&nbsp; In 1857 the tonnage entered had
risen to 2,834,107, and that cleared to 2,143,884.</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>The traffic on London Bridge may be considered as one of
the sights of London.&nbsp; A costermonger&rsquo;s cart, laden
with cabbages for Camberwell, breaks down, and there is a block
extending back almost all the way to the Mansion House.&nbsp;
Walk back and look at the passengers thus suddenly checked in
their gay career.&nbsp; Omnibuses are laden with pleasure seekers
on their way to the Crystal Palace.&nbsp; Look, there is
&ldquo;affliction sore&rdquo; displayed on many a countenance and
felt in many a heart.&nbsp; Mary Anne, who knows she is
undeniably late, and deserves to be left behind, thinks that her
young man won&rsquo;t wait for her.&nbsp; Little Mrs. B. sits
trembling with a dark cloud upon her brow, for she knows Mr. B.
has been at the station since one, and it is now past two.&nbsp;
Look at the pale, wan girl in the corner, asking if they will be
in time to catch the train for Hastings.&nbsp; You may well ask,
poor girl.&nbsp; Haste is vain now.&nbsp; Your hours are
numbered&mdash;the sands of your little life are just
run&mdash;your bloodless lip, your sunken eye, with its light not
of this world&mdash;your hectic cheek, from which the soft bloom
of youth has been rudely driven, make one feel emphatically in
your case that &ldquo;no medicine, though it oft&rsquo; can cure,
can always balk the tomb.&rdquo;&nbsp; What have you been&mdash;a
dressmaker, stitching fashionable silks for beauty, and at the
same time a plain shroud for yourself?&nbsp; What have you
been&mdash;a governess, rearing young lives at the sacrifice of
your own?&nbsp; What have you been&mdash;a daughter of sin and
shame?&nbsp; Ah, well, it is not for me to cast a stone at
you.&nbsp; Hasten on, every moment now <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>is worth a
king&rsquo;s ransom, and may He who never turned a daughter away
soften your pillow and sustain your heart in the dark hour I see
too plainly about to come.&nbsp; What is this, a chaise and four
greys.&nbsp; So young Jones has done it at last.&nbsp; Is he
happy, or has he already found his Laura slow, and has she
already begun to suspect that her Jones may turn out &ldquo;a
wretch&rdquo; after all.&nbsp; I know not yet has the sound of
his slightly vinous and foggy eloquence died away; still ring in
his ears the applause which greeted his announcement that
&ldquo;the present is the proudest of my life,&rdquo; and his
resolution, in all time to come, in sunshine and in storm, to
cherish in his heart of hearts the lovely being whom he now calls
his bride; but as he leans back there think you that already he
sees another face&mdash;for Jones has been a man-about-town, and
sometimes such as he get touched.&nbsp; This I know&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Feebly must they have felt<br />
Who in old time attired with snakes and whips<br />
The vengeful furies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even Jones may regret he married Laura and quarrelled with
Rose,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A rosebud set with little wilful thorns<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweet as English air could make her.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a wonderful thing it is when a man finds himself married,
all the excitement of the chase over.&nbsp; Let all Jones&rsquo;
and Laura&rsquo;s and persons about to marry see well that they
are really in love before they take the final plunge.&nbsp; But
hear that big party behind in a <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Hansom, using
most improper language.&nbsp; Take it easy, my dear sir, you may
catch the Dover train, you may cross to Calais, you may rush on
to Paris, but the electric telegraph has already told your crime,
and described your person.&nbsp; Therefore be calm, there is no
police officer dogging you, you are free for a few hours
yet.&nbsp; And now come our sleek city men, to Clapham and
Norwood, to dine greatly in their pleasant homes.&nbsp; The world
goes well with them, and indeed it ought, for they are honest as
the times go: are they slightly impatient, we cannot wonder at
it, the salmon may be overboiled, just because of that infernal
old coster&rsquo;s cart.&nbsp; Hurra! it moves, and away go
busses, and carriages, and broughams, and hansoms, and a thousand
of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, rich and poor, old and young,
saint and sinner, are in a good temper again, and cease to break
the commandments.&nbsp; Stand here of a morning while London yet
slumbers; what waggons and carts laden with provisions from the
rich gardens of Surrey and Kent, come over London Bridge.&nbsp;
Later, see how the clerks, and shopmen, and shopwomen,
hurry.&nbsp; Later still, and what trains full of stockbrokers,
and commission agents, and city merchants, from a circle
extending as far as Brighton, daily are landed at the London
Bridge Stations, and cross over.&nbsp; Later still, and what
crowds of ladies from the suburbs come shopping, or to visit
London exhibitions.&nbsp; If we were inclined to be uncharitable,
we might question some of these fair dames; I dare say people
connected with <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>the divorce courts might insinuate
very unpleasant things respecting some of them; but let us hope
that they are the exception, and that if Mrs. C. meets some one
at the West End who is not Captain C., and that if the Captain
dines with a gay party at Hampton Court, when he has informed his
wife that business will detain him in town; or that if that
beauty now driving past in a brougham has no business to be
there, that these sickly sheep do not infect the flock, and, in
the language of good Dr. Watts, poison all the rest.&nbsp; Yet
there are tales of sin and sorrow connected with London
Bridge.&nbsp; Over its stony parapets, down into its dark and
muddy waters, have men leaped in madness, and women in shame;
there, at the dead of night, has slunk away the wretch who feared
what the coming morrow would bring forth, to die.&nbsp; And here
woman&mdash;deceived, betrayed, deserted, broken in heart, and
blasted beyond all hope of salvation&mdash;has sought
repose.&nbsp; A few hours after and the sun has shone brightly,
and men have talked gaily on the very spot from whence the poor
creatures leapt.&nbsp; Well may we exclaim&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sky, oh were are thy cleansing waters<br />
Earth, oh where will thy wonders end.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chronicles of Old London Bridge are many and of eternal
interest.&nbsp; When Sweyn, king of Denmark, on plunder and
conquest bent, sailed up the Thames, there was a London Bridge
with turrets and roofed bulwarks.&nbsp; From 994 to 1750, that
bridge, built and rebuilt many <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>times, was
the sole land communication between the city and the Surrey bank
of the Thames.&nbsp; In Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time the bridge
had become a stately one.&nbsp; Norden describes it as adorned
with &ldquo;sumptuous buildings and statelie, and beautiful
houses on either syde,&rdquo; like one continuous street, except
&ldquo;certain wyde places for the retyre of passengers from the
danger of cars, carts, and droves of cattle, usually passing that
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Near the drawbridge, and overhanging the river,
was the famed Nonsuch House, imported from Holland, built
entirely of timber, four stories high, richly carved and
gilt.&nbsp; At the Southwark end was the Traitor&rsquo;s Gate,
where dissevered and ghastly heads were hung suspended in the
air.&nbsp; In 1212, the Southwark end caught fire, and 3000
persons perished miserably in the flames.&nbsp; In 1264 Henry
III. was repulsed here by Simon de Mountfort, earl of
Leicester.&nbsp; Thundering along this road to sudden death
rushed Wat Tyler, in 1381.&nbsp; Here came forth the citizens, in
all their bravery, ten years after, to meet Richard II.&nbsp;
Henry V. passed over this bridge twice, once in triumph, and once
to be laid down in his royal tomb.&nbsp; In 1450, we hear a voice
exclaiming: &ldquo;Jack Cade hath gotten London Bridge, and the
citizens fly and forsake their houses;&rdquo; and thus the
chronicle goes on.&nbsp; Nor must we forget the maid servant of
one Higges, a needle-maker, who, in carelessly placing some hot
coals under some stairs, set fire to the house, and thus raised a
conflagration which appears to have been of the most extensive
character.&nbsp; <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>On London Bridge lived Holbein and
Hogarth.&nbsp; Swift and Pope used to visit Arnold the bookseller
on this bridge.&nbsp; From off this bridge leaped an industrious
apprentice to save the life of his master&rsquo;s infant
daughter, dropped into the river by a careless nursemaid; the
father was Lord Mayor of London.&nbsp; The industrious apprentice
married the daughter, and the great-grandson of the happy pair
was the first duke of Leeds.&nbsp; On the first of August, 1831,
New London Bridge was opened with great pomp by King William IV.,
and since then the stream of life across the bridge has rushed
without intermission on.</p>

THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THE EARLY-CLOSING MOVEMENT.</h2>
<p>When is common sense to reign over man?&nbsp; According to Dr.
Cumming, in a few years we are to have the Millennium.&nbsp; Will
it be then?&nbsp; I fear not.&nbsp; At any rate, I am certain it
will not be before.</p>
<p>Look, for instance, at the House of Commons: the Lords meet
for debate a little after five, p.m., and separate generally a
little before six, p.m., and it is perfectly astonishing what an
immense amount of business they get through; but the Commons meet
at four, p.m., and sit till one or two, a.m.; the consequence is,
that very little business is done: that we have a great deal too
much talking; that really conscientious members, who will not
forsake their duties, but remain at their posts, are knocked up,
and have to cut Parliament for a time; and that what business is
done is often performed in the most slovenly and unsatisfactory
manner.&nbsp; A few minutes&rsquo; reflection will make this
clear.&nbsp; A bill is introduced, or, rather, leave is given to
a member to bring <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>it in.&nbsp; It is read a first
time.&nbsp; To the first reading of a bill generally little
opposition is made.&nbsp; The member who introduces it makes a
long speech in its favour, and little discussion takes
place.&nbsp; The real fight is when it is read a second
time.&nbsp; There are many ways of throwing out a bill without
the discourtesy of a positive rejection.&nbsp; The first of these
means consists in giving a preference to other
&ldquo;orders;&rdquo; the second is, moving &ldquo;the previous
question.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another is, moving &ldquo;that the second
reading take place this day six months.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the bill
get over the second reading, it then goes into committee, when
objectionable clauses are struck out and fresh ones added, till
the original proposer of the bill can hardly recognise his
offspring.&nbsp; The bill is then read a third time, and
afterwards sent up to the Lords.&nbsp; Possibly the Lords object
to some parts of it; a conference with the Commons is then
desired, which accordingly takes place, the deputation of the
Commons standing with uncovered heads, while the Lords, with hats
on, retain their seats.&nbsp; The matter being amicably arranged,
and a disagreeable collision avoided, the bill is passed through
the Lords, where it usually creates a far more orderly and less
passionate debate than it has done in the Commons.&nbsp; The
Lords being assembled in their own House, the Sovereign, or the
Commissioners, seated, and the Commons at the bar, the titles of
the several bills which have passed both Houses are read, and the
King or Queen&rsquo;s answer is declared by the clerk of the
Parliaments in Norman-French.&nbsp; <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>To a bill
of supply the assent is given in the following
words:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Le roy</i> (or, <i>la reine</i>)
<i>remercie ses loyal subjects</i>, <i>accepte leur
b&eacute;n&eacute;volence et ainsi le veut</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; To a
private bill it is thus declared:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Soit fait comme
il est desir&eacute;</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to public general
bills it is given in these terms:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Le roy</i> (or,
<i>la reine</i>) <i>le vent</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Should the
Sovereign refuse his assent, it is in the gentle language of
&ldquo;<i>Le roy</i> (or, <i>la reine</i>)
<i>s&rsquo;aviser</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; As acts of grace and amnesty
originate with the Crown, the clerk, expressing the gratitude of
the subject, addresses the throne as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Les
pr&eacute;lats</i>, <i>seigneurs</i>, <i>et commons</i>, <i>en ce
present Parliament assembl&eacute;s</i>, <i>au nom de tout vous
autres subjects</i>,<i> remercient tr&egrave;s-humblement votre
majest&eacute;</i>, <i>et prient &agrave; Dieu vous donner en
sant&eacute; bonne vie et longue</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The moment the
royal assent has been given, that which was a bill becomes an
Act, and <i>instantly</i> has the force and effect of law, unless
some time for the commencement of its operation should have been
specially appointed.&nbsp; Occasionally a bill is introduced in
the form of a motion, at other times as a resolution, but
generally the bill is the favourite form.&nbsp; Any bill which
the Lords can originate may be introduced and laid on the table
by any individual peer, without the previous permission of the
house; but in the Commons, no bill can be brought in unless a
motion for leave be previously agreed to.&nbsp; Mr. Dodd tells
us, &ldquo;During the progress of a bill the House <i>may</i>
divide on the following questions:&mdash;1. Leave to bring it
in.&nbsp; 2. When brought in, whether it shall then be read a
first time, and if not, when?&nbsp; 3. On <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>the first
reading.&nbsp; 4. On the second reading.&nbsp; 5. That it be
committed.&nbsp; 6. On the question that the Speaker do leave the
chair, for the house to resolve itself into such committee.&nbsp;
7. That the report of the committee be received.&nbsp; 8. That
the bill be re-committed.&nbsp; 9. That it be engrossed.&nbsp;
10. That it be read a third time.&nbsp; 11. That it do
pass.&nbsp; 12. The title of the bill.&nbsp; These are quite
exclusive of any divisions concerning the particular days to be
appointed for proceeding with any stage of the measure, or of any
proceedings in committee, or any amendments, or any clauses added
to or expunged from the measure in or out of
committee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus it is Acts of Parliament often made
in one sense are ruled by the judges to have another, and we have
Acts to amend Acts in endless succession.&nbsp; Tom Moore tells
us of an Act of Parliament referring to a new prison, in which it
was stated that the new one should be built with the materials of
the old, and that the prisoners were to remain in the old prison
till the new one was ready.&nbsp; This is an extreme case, but
blunders equally absurd are made every day.</p>
<p>What is the remedy?&nbsp; Why, none other than the panacea
recommended by Mr. Lilwall as applicable to every earthly
ill&mdash;the Early-closing Movement.&nbsp; Early closing in the
House of Commons would shut up the lawyers, who want to make long
speeches&mdash;the diners-out, who enter the House ofttimes in a
state of hilarity more calculated to heighten confusion than to
promote business&mdash;the young swells, to whom the House of
Commons <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>is a club, and nothing more.&nbsp;
We should have a smaller house, but one more ready to do
business; and if we should lose a few lawyers on promotion, and,
consequently, very industrious, very active, and very eloquent,
that loss would be compensated by the addition to the House of
many men of great talent and political capacity, who cannot stand
the late hours and the heated atmosphere, and the frightfully
lengthy speeches, and the furious partisanship of the House as at
present constituted.</p>
<p>I have seen it suggested that a large board should be placed
behind the Speaker&rsquo;s chair; and that when any member makes
a point, or advances an argument, the point or argument, whether
for or against the measure, should be noted down and numbered;
that a speaker, instead of repeating the point or argument, as is
now the case, should simply mention the No. 1, 2, or 3, as the
case may be, and say, &ldquo;I vote for the bill because of No.
1,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; We should then have no vain
repetitions; business would be done better, and more speedily;
members would not be confused; the reporters would not have so
much trouble as now; and the patient public would be spared the
infliction in their daily organs of column after column of
parliamentary debate.&nbsp; The advantage of the Early-closing
Movement in the House of Commons would be, that it would compel
the House to adopt some measure of the kind.&nbsp; It is curious
to trace the increase of late hours.&nbsp; In Clarendon&rsquo;s
time &ldquo;the House met always at eight o&rsquo;clock and rose
at <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>twelve, which were the old parliamentary hours, that
the committees, upon whom the great burden of the business lay,
might have the afternoon for their preparation and
despatch.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes the House seems to have met at
cock-crowing.&nbsp; In the journals and old orders of the House
we find such entries as the following:&mdash;&ldquo;March 26,
1604.&nbsp; Having obtained permission of her Majesty to attend
at eight, the Commons previously met at six to treat on what
shall be delivered tending the reason of their
proceedings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;May 31, 1614.&nbsp;
Ordered, that the House shall sit every day at seven
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and to begin to read bills for the
first time at ten.&rdquo;&nbsp; The journals record that on
Sunday, August 8, 1641, at six o&rsquo;clock a.m., the Commons go
down to St. Margaret&rsquo;s, and hear prayers and a sermon,
returning to the House at nine.&nbsp; This, however, was
occasioned by the eagerness of the members to prevent the
king&rsquo;s journey to Scotland, and a minute was made that it
should not be considered as a precedent.&nbsp; The Long
Parliament resolved, &ldquo;that whosoever shall not be here at
prayers every morning at eight o&rsquo;clock shall pay one
shilling to the poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; James I. mentioned as an
especial grievance, that the Commons brought the protestation
concerning their liberties into the House <i>at six o&rsquo;clock
at night</i>, <i>by candle-light</i>!&nbsp; &ldquo;I move,&rdquo;
said Serjeant Wylde, &ldquo;against sitting in the
afternoon.&nbsp; This council is a grave council and sober, and
ought not to do things in the dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir A.
Haselrigge said he never knew good come of candles.&nbsp; Sir
William Waddington <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>brought in two from the clerk
against the direction of the House, and was committed to the
Tower next morning.&nbsp; Having sat on the occasion till seven,
Sir H. Vane complained, &ldquo;We are not able to hold out
sitting thus in the night.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the Revolution
matters got worse.&nbsp; Bishop Burnet complains that the House
did not meet till twelve; and in the next generation Speaker
Onslow adds, &ldquo;This is grown shamefully of late, even to two
of the clock.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the time of Pitt and Fox the evil
reached its climax.&nbsp; The motion for the Speaker leaving the
chair on Fox&rsquo;s India Bill was put to the vote at half-past
four in the morning.&nbsp; During the Westminster scrutiny the
House sometimes sat till six a.m.&nbsp; Pitt, speaking on the
slave-trade, introduced his beautiful quotation relative to the
sun as it was then just bursting on his audience.&nbsp; Sir
Samuel Romilly tells us that he would not unfrequently go to bed
at his usual time, and rising next morning somewhat earlier than
usual would go down to be present at the division.&nbsp; I think
it was during the Reform debates that an hon. M.P., having been
present at the discussion the previous night, and being desirous
to secure a good place the next evening, went down to the House
early in the morning for that special purpose, and found the
debate, at the commencement of which he had been present, and
which he thought had long been over, proceeding hotly and
furiously.&nbsp; In the last session of parliament the house
sinned greatly in this respect.&nbsp; I am told this state of
things is for the advantage of the lawyers, who otherwise would
not be <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>able to attend in the House at all;
but it may be questioned whether this is such a benefit as some
suppose, and certainly the midnight hour, especially after mind
and body have alike been jaded by the strain of a long debate, is
not the best for passing measures of a legislative character; and
yet it is in the small hours, when members are weary, or, we
fear, in some cases slightly vinous, or indifferent and
apathetic, that most of the real business of the nation is
performed.&nbsp; Now against this bad habit for many years Mr.
Brotherton waged an incessant but unsuccessful war.&nbsp; As soon
as ever midnight arrived the hon. gentleman was on his legs,
warning honourable members of its arrival, and of the injury
which late hours must necessarily occasion to their own health,
and to the satisfactory progress of public business.&nbsp; In his
attempts Mr. Brotherton then was aiming as much at the good of
the nation as well as the advantage of the members of the
House.&nbsp; Many were the scenes occasioned by Mr.
Brotherton&rsquo;s importunity.&nbsp; Mr. Grant says, &ldquo;I
have seen one look him most imploringly in the face, and heard
him say, in tones and with a manner as coaxing as if the party
had been wooing his mistress, &lsquo;Do not just yet, Mr.
Brotherton; wait one half hour until this business be disposed
of.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have seen a second seize him by the right arm,
while a third grasped him by the left, with the view of causing
him to resume his seat, and when his sense of duty overcame all
these efforts to seduce or force him from its path, I have seen a
fourth honourable gentleman <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>rush to the
assistance of the others, and taking hold of the tail of his
coat, literally press him to his seat.&nbsp; I have seen Mr.
Brotherton, with a perseverance beyond all praise, in his
righteous and most patriotic cause, suddenly start again to his
feet in less than five minutes, and move a second time the
adjournment of the House, and I have again had the misfortune to
see physical force triumph over the best moral purposes.&nbsp;
Five or six times have I witnessed the repetition of this in one
night.&nbsp; On one occasion, I remember seeing an honourable
member actually clap his hand on Mr. Brotherton&rsquo;s mouth, in
order to prevent his moving the dreaded adjournment.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Constant ill-success damped Mr. Brotherton&rsquo;s ardour.&nbsp;
There was a time when his object seemed attained, but in the last
session he attended the Commons were as bad as ever.&nbsp; Mr.
Brotherton having made a futile attempt when the session was
young, in favour of the Early-closing Movement, abandoned his
position in despair.&nbsp; The call for Brotherton ceased to be a
watchword with our less hopeful senators, and Mr.
Bouverie&rsquo;s view, that more business was got through after
twelve o&rsquo;clock at night than before, appeared to be
generally acquiesced in, with a species of reluctant despair
which was unanswerable.&nbsp; Still it is true that early to bed
and early to rise will make the Commons more healthy and wise,
though the general practice seems to be the other way.</p>

TOWN MORALS.</h2>
<p>Have you seen Charles Matthews in &ldquo;Used Up?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sir Charles Coldstream represents us all.&nbsp; We are
everlastingly seeking a sensation, and never finding it.&nbsp;
Sir Charles&rsquo;s valet&rsquo;s description of him describes us
all:&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always sighing for what he calls
excitement&mdash;you see, everything is old to
him&mdash;he&rsquo;s used up&mdash;nothing amuses him&mdash;he
can&rsquo;t feel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he looks in the crater of
Vesuvius and finds nothing in it, and the Bay of Naples he
considers inferior to that of Dublin&mdash;the Campagna to him is
a swamp&mdash;Greece a morass&mdash;Athens a bad
Edinburgh&mdash;Egypt a desert&mdash;the pyramids humbugs.&nbsp;
The same confession is on every one&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; The boy
of sixteen, with a beardless chin, has a melancholy
<i>blas&eacute;</i> air; the girl gets wise, mourns over the
vanity of life, and laughs at love as a romance; a
heart&mdash;unless it be a bullock&rsquo;s, and well
cooked,&mdash;is tacitly understood to be a mistake; and
conscience a thing that no one can afford to keep.&nbsp; Our
young men are bald at twenty-five, and woman is exhausted still
sooner.&nbsp; I am told Quakers <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>are
sometimes moved by the spirit.&nbsp; I am told mad Ranters sing,
and preach, and roar as if they were in earnest.&nbsp; I hear
that there is even enthusiasm amongst the Mormons; but that
matters little.&nbsp; We are very few of us connected with such
<i>outre</i> sects, and the exceptions but prove the rule.</p>
<p>But a truce to generalities.&nbsp; Let us give modern
instances.&nbsp; Look at Jenkins, the genteel stockbroker.&nbsp;
In autumn he may be seen getting into his brougham, which already
contains his better-half and the olive-branches that have blessed
their mutual loves.&nbsp; This brougham will deposit the
Jenkinses, and boxes of luggage innumerable, at the Brighton
Railway Terminus, whence it is their intention to start for that
crowded and once fashionable watering-place.&nbsp; Jenkins has
been dying all the summer of the heat.&nbsp; Why, like the
blessed ass as he is, did he stop in town, when for a few
shillings he might have been braced and cooled by sea breezes,
but because of that monotony which forbids a man consulting
nature and common sense.&nbsp; Jenkins only goes out of town when
the fashionable world goes; he would not for the life of him
leave till the season was over.</p>
<p>Again, does ever the country look lovelier than when the snows
of winter reluctantly make way for the first flowers of
spring?&nbsp; Is ever the air more balmy or purer than when the
young breath of summer, like a tender maiden, kisses timidly the
cheek, and winds its way, like a blessing from above, to the
weary heart?&nbsp; Does ever the sky look bluer, or the sun more
glorious, or the <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>earth more green, or is ever the
melody of birds more musical, than then? and yet at that time the
<i>beau monde</i> must resort to town, and London drawing-rooms
must emit a polluted air, and late hours must enfeeble, and
bright eyes must become dull, and cheeks that might have vied in
loveliness with the rose, sallow and pale.</p>
<p>It is a fine thing for a man to get hold of a good cause; one
of the finest sights that earth can boast is that of a man or set
of men standing up to put into action what they know to be some
blessed God-sent truth.&nbsp; A Cromwell mourning the flat Popery
of St. Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;a Luther, before principalities and
powers, exclaiming, &ldquo;Here stand I and will not move, so
help me God!&rdquo;&mdash;a Howard making a tour of the jails of
Europe, and dying alone and neglected on the shores of the Black
Sea&mdash;a Henry Martyn leaving the cloistered halls of
Cambridge, abandoning the golden prospects opening around him,
and abandoning what is dearer still, the evils of youth, to
preach Christ, and Him crucified, beneath the burning and fatal
sun of the East&mdash;or a Hebrew maiden, like Jepthah&rsquo;s
daughter, dying for her country or her country&rsquo;s
good,&mdash;are sights rare and blessed, and beautiful and
divine.&nbsp; All true teachers are the same, and are glorious to
behold.&nbsp; For a time no one regards their testimony.&nbsp;
The man stands by himself&mdash;a reed, but not shaken by the
wind&mdash;a voice crying in the wilderness&mdash;a John the
Baptist nursed in the wilds, and away from the deadening spell of
the world.&nbsp; <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Then comes the influence of the
solitary thinker on old fallacies; the young and the enthusiastic
rush to his side, the sceptic and the scoffer one by one
disappear, and the world is conquered; or if it be not so, if he
languishes in jail like Galileo, or wanders on the face of the
earth seeking rest and finding none, like our Puritan
forefathers; or die, as many an hero has died, as the Christ did,
when the power of the Prince of Darkness prevailed, and the veil
of the Temple was rent in twain; still there is for him a
resurrection, when a coming age will honour his memory, collect
his scattered ashes, and build them a fitting tomb.&nbsp; Yet
even this kind of heroism has come to be but a monotonous
affair.</p>
<p>Now-a-days the thing can be done, and in one way&mdash;a
meeting at Exeter Hall, a dinner at Freemasons&rsquo; tavern,
Harker for toast-master, a few vocalists to sing between the
pieces, and for chairman a lord by all means; if possible, a
royal duke.&nbsp; The truest thing about us is our
appetite.&nbsp; Our appreciation of a hero is as our appreciation
of a coat; a saviour of a nation and a Soyer we class together,
and do justice to both at the same time.&nbsp; We moderns eat
where our fathers bled.&nbsp; Our powers we show by the number of
bottles of wine we can consume; our devotion is to our dinners;
the sword has made way for the carving-knife; our battle is
against the ills to which gluttonness and wine-bibbing flesh is
heir; the devil that comes to us is the gout; the hell in which
we believe and against which we fight is indigestion; our means
of grace are blue pill and <!-- page 114--><a

draught.&nbsp; All art and science and lettered lore, all the
memories of the past and the hopes of the future&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All thoughts, all passions, all
delights&mdash;<br />
Whatever stirs this mortal frame,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>now-a-days, tend to dinner.&nbsp; Our sympathy with the
unfortunate females, or the indigent blind, with the propagation
of the Gospel in foreign parts, or with the diffusion of useful
knowledge at home&mdash;with the Earl of Derby or Mr.
Cobden&mdash;with Lord John Russell or Mr. Disraeli&mdash;with
the soldier who has blustered and bullied till the world has
taken him for a hero&mdash;with the merchant who has bound
together in the peaceful pursuits of trade hereditary
foes&mdash;with the engineer who has won dominion over time and
space&mdash;with the poet who has sat</p>

<p>finds a common mode of utterance, and that utterance to all
has a common emphasis.&nbsp; Even the Church apes the world in
this respect; and even that section which calls itself
non-conforming, conforms here.&nbsp; When dinner is concerned, it
forgets to protest, and becomes dumb.&nbsp; Dr. Watts might
sing,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lord, what a wretched land is this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That yields us no supplies;&rdquo;</p>

ordination dinners, of grand dinners when a new chapel is erected
or an old pastor retires.&nbsp; But lately I saw one reverend
gentleman at law with another.&nbsp; Most of my readers will
recollect the case.&nbsp; It was that of Tidman against
Ainslie.&nbsp; Dr. Tidman triumphs, and the Missionary Society is
vindicated.&nbsp; What was the consequence?&mdash;a dinner to Dr.
Tidman at the Guildhall Coffee-house, at which all the leading
ministers of the denomination to which he belonged were
present.</p>
<p>The Queen is the fountain of honour.&nbsp; What has been the
manner of men selected for royal honour?&nbsp; The last instance
is Lord Dudley, who has been made an earl.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Is it
that he lent Mr. Lumley nearly &pound;100,000 to keep the
Haymarket Opera House open? because really this is all the
general public knows about Lord Dudley.&nbsp; The other day Lord
Derby was the means of getting a peerage for a wealthy and
undistinguished commoner.&nbsp; Is it come to this, then, that we
give to rich men, as such, honours which ought to be precious,
and awarded by public opinion to the most gifted and the most
illustrious of our fellows.&nbsp; If in private life I toady a
rich swell, that I may put my feet under his mahogany, and drink
his wine, besides making an ass of myself, I do little harm; but
if we prostitute the honours of the nation, the nation itself
suffers; and, as regards noble sentiments and enlightened public
spirit, withers and declines.</p>

young.&nbsp; I believe it.&nbsp; At present it is little better
than an experiment.&nbsp; If it be a good, it is not without its
disadvantages.&nbsp; It has its drawbacks.&nbsp; Man gives up
something for it.&nbsp; One of its greatest evils perhaps is its
monotony, which makes us curse and mourn our fate&mdash;which
forces from our lips the exclamation of Mariana, in the

<p>&mdash;what is it, we would ask, most magnanimous Sir, in the
most delicate manner imaginable, that keeps you standing by the
hour together, looking out of the window of your club in Pall
Mall, in the utter weariness of your heart, swearing now at the
weather, now at the waiter, and, anon, muttering something about
your dreaming that you dwelt in marble halls, but that very
monotony of civilization which we so much deprecate?&nbsp; Were
it not for that, you might be working in this working
world&mdash;touching the very kernel and core of life, instead of
thus feeding on its shell.&nbsp; <!-- page 117--><a

be that the soft eye of woman looks down on what we now write,
what is it, we would ask, O peerless paragon, O celestial
goddess, but the same feeling that makes you put aside the last
new novel, and, in shameless defiance of the rules taught in that
valuable publication and snob&rsquo;s <i>vade
mecum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Hints on the Etiquette and the Usages of
Society,&rdquo; actually yawn&mdash;aye, yawn, when that gold
watch, hanging by your most fairy-like and loveliest of forms,
does not tell one hour that does not bear with it from earth to
heaven some tragedy acted&mdash;some villainy achieved&mdash;some
heroic thing done: aye, yawn, when before you is spread out the
great <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of life, with its laughter and
tears&mdash;with its blasts from hell&mdash;with its odours
coming down from heaven itself.&nbsp; A brave, bold,
noble-hearted Miss Nightingale breaks through this monotony, and
sails to nurse the wounded or the dying of our army in the East,
and &ldquo;Common Sense&rdquo; writes in newspapers against such
a noble act; and a religious paper saw in it Popery at the very
least.&nbsp; What a howl has there been in some quarters because
a few clergymen have taken to preaching in theatres!&nbsp; Even,
woman&rsquo;s heart, with its gushing sympathies, has become dead
and shrivelled up, where that relentless scourge&mdash;that demon
of our time, the monotony of civilization&mdash;has been suffered
to intrude.&nbsp; It is owing to that, that when we look for
deeds angels might love to do, our daughters, and sisters, and
those whom we most passionately love, scream out Italian songs
which neither they <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>nor we understand, and bring to us,
as the result of their noblest energies, a fancy bag or a chain
of German wool.&nbsp; Such is the result of what Sir W. Curtis
termed the three R&rsquo;s and the usual accomplishments.&nbsp;
Humanity has been stereotyped.&nbsp; We follow one another like a
flock of sheep.&nbsp; We have levelled with a vengeance; we have
reduced the doctrine of human equality to an absurdity&mdash;we
live alike, think alike, die alike.&nbsp; A party in a parlour in
Belgrave Square, &ldquo;all silent and all d---d,&rdquo; is as
like a party in a parlour in Hackney as two peas.&nbsp; The beard
movement was a failure; so was the great question of hat reform,
and for similar reasons.&nbsp; We still scowl upon a man with a
wide-a-wake, as we should upon a pick-pocket or a
cut-throat.&nbsp; A leaden monotony hangs heavy on us all.&nbsp;
Not more does one man or woman differ from another than does
policeman A1 differ from policeman A 999.&nbsp; Individuality
seems gone: independent life no longer exists.&nbsp; Our very
thought and inner life is that of Buggins, who lives next
door.&nbsp; The skill of the tailor has made us all one, and man,
as God made him, cuts but a sorry figure by the side of man as
his tailor made him.&nbsp; This is an undeniable fact: it is not
only true but <i>the</i> truth.&nbsp; One motive serves for every
variety of deed&mdash;for dancing the polka or marrying a
wife&mdash;for wearing white gloves or worshipping the Most
High.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate, my dears,&rdquo; said a
fashionable dame to her daughters when they turned round to go
home, on finding that the crowded state of the church to which
they repaired would not admit of their worshipping <!-- page
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>according to Act of Parliament,&mdash;&ldquo;At any
rate, my dears, we have done the genteel thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; By
that mockery to God she had made herself right in the sight of
man.&nbsp; Actually we are all so much alike that not very long
since in Madrid a journeyman tailor was mistaken for a
Prince.&nbsp; It is not always that such extreme cases happen;
but the tendency of civilization, as we have it now, is to work
us all up into one common, unmeaning whole&mdash;to confound all
the old distinctions by which classes were marked&mdash;to mix up
the peasant and the prince, more by bringing down the latter than
elevating the former; and thus we all become unmeaning, and
monotonous, and common-place.&nbsp; The splendid livery in which
&ldquo;Jeames&rdquo; rejoices may show that he is footman to a
family that dates from the Conquest: it may be that he is footman
to the keeper of the ham and beef shop near London Bridge.&nbsp;
The uninitiated cannot tell the difference.&nbsp; A man says he
is a lord; otherwise we should not take him for one of the nobles
of the earth.&nbsp; A man puts on a black gown, and says he is a
religious teacher: otherwise we should not take him for one who
could understand and enlighten the anxious yearnings of the human
heart.&nbsp; The old sublime faith in God and heaven is
gone.&nbsp; We have had none of it since the days of old Noll: it
went out when Charles and his mistresses came in.&nbsp; But
instead, we have a world of propriety and conventionalism.&nbsp;
We have a universal worshipping of Mrs. Grundy.&nbsp; A craven
fear sits in the hearts of all.&nbsp; Men dare not be generous,
high-minded, and true.&nbsp; A <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>man dares
not act otherwise than the class by which he is surrounded: he
must conform to their regulations or die; outside the pale there
is no hope.&nbsp; If he would not be as others are, it were
better that a millstone were hung round his neck and that he were
cast into the sea.&nbsp; If, as a tradesman, he will not devote
his energies to money-making&mdash;if he will not rise up early
and sit up late&mdash;if he will not starve the mind&mdash;if he
will not violate the conditions by which the physical and mental
powers are sustained&mdash;he will find that in Christian
England, in the nineteenth century, there is no room for such as
he.&nbsp; The externals which men in their ignorance have come to
believe essential to happiness, he will see
another&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Great city
&ldquo;feeds&rdquo;&mdash;white-bait dinners at Blackwall, and
&ldquo;genteel residences,&rdquo; within a few miles of the Bank
or the bridges&mdash;fat coachmen and fiery
steeds&mdash;corporation honours and emoluments,&mdash;a man may
seek in vain if he will not take first, the ledger for his
Gospel, and mammon for his God.&nbsp; It is just the same with
the professions.&nbsp; Would the &ldquo;most distinguished
counsel&rdquo; ever have a brief were he to scorn to employ the
powers God has given him to obtain impunity for the man whose
heart&rsquo;s life has become polluted with crime beyond the
power of reform.&nbsp; Many a statesman has to thank a similar
laxity of conscience for his place and power.</p>

THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</h2>
<p>I am not in the best of humours.&nbsp; The wind and weather of
the last few months have been bad enough to vex the temper and
destroy the patience of a saint.&nbsp; I wish the papers would
write a little more about reforms at home, and not trouble
themselves about the Emperor of the French.&nbsp; I wish country
gentlemen, when airing their vocabularies at agricultural
dinners, would not talk so much of our friends across the water
being desirous to avenge the disgrace of Waterloo, as if there
were any disgrace to France, after having been a match,
single-handed, for all Europe for a generation, in being
compelled to succumb at last.&nbsp; I wish we could be content
with trading with China, without sending ambassadors to Pekin,
and endeavouring by fair means or foul to make that ancient city,
as regards red-tapeism and diplomatic quarrels, as great a
nuisance as Constantinople is now.&nbsp; I wish Mr. George
Augustus Sala, with that wonderful talent of his for imitating
Dickens and Thackeray, would quite forget there was such <!--
page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>gentlemen in the world, and write independently of
them.&nbsp; And I wish the little essayists, who copy Mr. George
Augustus Sala, and are so very smart and facetious by his aid,
would either swim without corks, or not swim at all.&nbsp; Thank
heaven, none of them are permanent, and most of them speedily
sink down into limbo.&nbsp; Where are the gaudily-covered
miscellanies, and other light productions of this class? if not
dead, why on every second-hand book-stall in London, in vain
seeking a sale at half-price, and dear at the money.&nbsp; But
the spirit of which they are the symptom, of which they are the
outward and visible sign, lives.&nbsp; Directly you take up one
of these books, you know what is coming.&nbsp; But after all, why
quarrel with these butterflies, who, at any rate, have a good
conceit of themselves, if they have but a poor opinion of
others?&nbsp; Fontaine tells of a motherly crab, who exclaimed
against the obliquity of her daughter&rsquo;s gait, and asked
whether she could not walk straight.&nbsp; The young crab
pleaded, very reasonably, the similarity of her parent&rsquo;s
manner of stepping, and asked whether she could be expected to
walk differently from the rest of the family?</p>
<p>This fable throws me back on general principles; our
writers&mdash;our preachers&mdash;our statesmen, are fearful, and
tremble at the appearance of originality.&nbsp; The age overrules
us all, society is strong, and the individual is consequently
weak.&nbsp; We have no patrons now, but, instead, we have a
mob.&nbsp; Attend a public meeting,&mdash;the speaker who is the
most applauded, is the man most <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>given to
exaggeration.&nbsp; Listen to a popular preacher,&mdash;is he not
invariably the most commonplace, and in his sermons least
suggestive, of men?&nbsp; When a new periodical is projected,
what care is taken that it shall contain nothing to offend, as if
a man or writer were worth a rap that did not come into collision
with some prejudices, and trample on some corns.&nbsp; In
describing some ceremony where beer had been distributed, a
teetotal reporter, writing for a teetotal public, omitted all
mention of the beer.&nbsp; This is ridiculous, but such things
are done every day in all classes.&nbsp; Society exercises a
censorship over the press of the most distinctive
character.&nbsp; The song says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Have faith in one another.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say, have faith in yourself.&nbsp; This faith in oneself
would go far to put society in a better position than it
is.&nbsp; A common complaint in everybody&rsquo;s mouth is the
want of variety in individual character&mdash;the dreary monotony
we find everywhere pervading society.&nbsp; Men and women, lads
and maidens, boys and girls, if we may call the little dolls
dressed up in crinoline and flounces, and the young gentlemen in
patent-leather boots, such, are all alike.&nbsp; Civilization is
a leveller of the most destructive kind.&nbsp; Man is timid,
imitative, and lazy.&nbsp; Hence, it is to the past we must turn,
whenever we would recall to our minds how sublime and great man,
in his might and majesty, may become.&nbsp; Hence it is we can
reckon upon but few who dare to stand alone in devotedness to
truth and human right.&nbsp; Most men are <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>enslaved by
the opinions of the little clique in which they move; they can
never imagine that beyond their little circle there can exist
anything that is lovely or of good report.&nbsp; We are the men,
and wisdom will die with us, is the burden of their song.&nbsp;
We judge not according to abstract principles, but conventional
ideas.&nbsp; Ask a young lady, of average intelligence,
respecting some busy hive of industry, and intelligence, and
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaims, &ldquo;there is no
society in such a place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ask an evangelical
churchman as to a certain locality, and he will reply, &ldquo;Oh
it is very dark, dark, indeed;&rdquo; as if there was a spot on
this blessed earth where God&rsquo;s sun did not shine.&nbsp; The
dancing Bayaderes, who visited London some fifteen years back,
were shocked at what they conceived the immodest attire of our
English dames, who, in their turn, were thankful that they did
not dress as the Bayaderes.&nbsp; All uneducated people, or
rather all unreflective people, are apt to reason in this way;
orthodoxy is my doxy, heterodoxy, yours.&nbsp; But we English,
especially, are liable to this fallacy, on account of our insular
position, and the reserve and phlegm of our national
character.&nbsp; Abroad people travel more, come more into
collision with each other, socially are more equal.&nbsp; We can
only recognize goodness and greatness in certain forms.&nbsp;
People must be well-dressed, must be of respectable family, must
go to church, and then they may carry on any rascality.&nbsp; Sir
John Dean Paul, Redpath, and others, were types of this
class.&nbsp; Hence it is society stagnates&mdash;such is a
description of a <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>general law, illustrated in all
history, especially our own.&nbsp; Society invariably sets itself
against all great improvements in their birth.&nbsp; Society
gives the cold shoulder to whatever has lifted up the human
race&mdash;to whatever has illustrated and adorned
humanity&mdash;to whatever has made the world wiser and
better.&nbsp; Our fathers stoned the prophets, and we continue
the amiable custom.&nbsp; Our judgment is not our own, but that
of other people.&nbsp; We think what will other people think? our
first question is not, Is a course of action right or wrong? but;
What will Mr. Grundy say?&nbsp; Here is the great blunder of
blunders.&nbsp; John the Baptist lived in a desert.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I had read as much as other men,&rdquo; said Hobbes,
&ldquo;I should have been as ignorant as they.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I began to write against indulgences,&rdquo; says
Luther, &ldquo;I was for three years entirely alone; not a single
soul holding out the hand of fellowship and co&ouml;peration to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of Milton, Wordsworth writes, &ldquo;his soul
was like a star, and dwelt apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great original thinker of the last generation, John
Foster, actually fled the face of man.&nbsp; What a life of
persecution and misrepresentation had Arnold of Rugby to endure,
and no wonder, when we quote against the conclusions of common
sense the imaginary opinions of an imaginary scarecrow we term
society.&nbsp; This deference to the opinion of others is an
unmitigated evil.&nbsp; In no case is it a legitimate rule of
action.&nbsp; The chances are that society is on the wrong side,
as men of independent thought and action are in the minority,
<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>and even if society be right; it is not from a desire
to win her smile or secure her favour that a man should
act.&nbsp; It is not the judgment of others that a man must seek,
but his own; it is by that he must act&mdash;by that he must
stand or fall&mdash;by that he must live&mdash;and by that he
must die.&nbsp; All real life is internal, all honest action is
born of honest thought; out of the heart are the issues of
life.&nbsp; The want of exercising one&rsquo;s own understanding
has been admirably described by Locke.&nbsp; It is that, he says,
which weakens and extinguishes this noble faculty in us.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Trace it, and see whether it be not so; the day labourer
in a country village has commonly but a small pittance of
knowledge, because his ideas and notions have been confined to
the narrow bounds of a poor conversation and employment; the low
mechanic of a country town does somewhat outdo him&mdash;porters
and cobblers of great cities surpass him.&nbsp; A country
gentleman, leaving Latin and Learning in the University, who
returns thence to his mansion-house, and associates with his
neighbours of the same strain, who relish nothing but hunting and
a bottle; with these alone he spends his time, with these alone
he converses, and can away with no company whose discourses go
beyond what claret and dissoluteness inspire.&nbsp; Such a
patriot, formed in this happy day of improvement, cannot fail, we
see, to give notable decisions upon the bench at quarter
sessions, and eminent proofs of his skill in politics, when the
strength of his purse, and party, have advanced him to a more
<!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>auspicious situation. * * * To carry this a little
further: here is one muffled up in the zeal and infallibility of
his own sect, and will not touch a book, or enter into debate,
with a person that will question any of those things which, to
him, are sacred.&rdquo;&nbsp; People wonder now-a-days why we
have so many societies&mdash;the cause is the same.&nbsp; Men
cannot trust themselves; to do that requires exercise of the
understanding.&nbsp; A man must take his opinions from society;
he can do no battle with the devil unless he have an association
formed to aid him.&nbsp; At Oxford the example of an individual,
Dr. Livingstone, created a generous enthusiasm.&nbsp; A society
was formed under distinguished patronage, subscription lists were
opened, a public meeting was held, and the most renowned men of
the day&mdash;the Bishop of Oxford and Mr. Gladstone&mdash;lent
to the meeting not merely the attraction of their presence, but
the charm of their oratorical powers.&nbsp; The result is a very
small collection, and a talk of sending out six missionaries to
christianize Africa.&nbsp; When societies are formed there is no
end to the absurdities they are guilty of.&nbsp; Just think of
the men of science at Aberdeen, all rushing over hill and dale to
Balmoral, where they were permitted, not to converse with majesty
(that were too great an act of condescension), but to have lunch
in an apartment of the royal residence.&nbsp; Then, again, what
murmurs were there at Bradford, because, at the close of the
meeting, the younger members of the Social Reform Congress were
not permitted to dance the polka.&nbsp; If old <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Columbus
were alive now a new world would never have been
discovered.&nbsp; We should have had a limited liability company
established for the purpose.&nbsp; A board of lawyers, and
merchants, and M.P.&rsquo;s, as directors, would have been
formed.&nbsp; Some good-natured newspaper editors would have
inserted some ingenious puffs,&mdash;the shares would have gone
up in the market,&mdash;the directors would have sold out at a
very fair rate of profit.&nbsp; Columbus would have made one or
two unsuccessful voyages&mdash;the shares would have gone
down&mdash;the company would have been wound up&mdash;and no
western continent, with its vast resources, would ever have been
heard of.&nbsp; I like the old plan best; I like to see a
man.&nbsp; If I go into the House of Commons I hear of men,
somewhat too much talk of men is there; on one side of the house
Pitt is quoted, on another Fox, or Peel, or Canning.&nbsp; If
Pitt, and Fox, and Canning, and Peel had done so depend upon it
we should never have heard their names.&nbsp; It is a poor sign
when our statesmen get into this habit; it is a mutual confession
of inability to act according to the wants and necessities of the
age.&nbsp; They quote great men to hide their littleness.&nbsp;
They imagine that by using the words of great statesmen they may
become such, or, at any rate, get the public to note them for
such themselves.&nbsp; They use the names of Pitt and Fox as
corks, by means of which they may keep afloat.&nbsp; Well, I must
fain do the same; while I rail against custom, I must e&rsquo;en
follow her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to me,&rdquo; said old Montaigne, &ldquo;to
have <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>had a right and true apprehension of
the power of custom, who first invented the story of a
country-woman who, having accustomed herself to play with and
carry a young calf in her arms, and daily continuing to do so as
it grew up obtained this by custom, that when grown to a great ox
she was still able to bear it.&nbsp; For, in truth, custom is a
violent and treacherous schoolmistress.&nbsp; She by little and
little, slyly and unperceived, slips in the foot of her
authority, but having by this gentle and humble beginning, with
the benefit of time, fixed and established it, she then unmasks a
furious and tyrannical countenance, against which we have no more
the courage or the power so much as to lift up our eyes.&nbsp; We
see it at every turn forcing and violating the rules of
nature.&nbsp; <i>Usus efficacissimus rerum omnium
magister</i>.&nbsp; Custom is the greatest master of all
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now I finish with a fable.&nbsp; A knight surprised a
giant of enormous size and wickedness sleeping, his head lying
under the shade of a big oak.&nbsp; The knight prayed to heaven
to aid his strength, and lifting his battle-axe dashed it with
all his might on the giant&rsquo;s forehead.&nbsp; The giant
opened his eyes, and drowsily passing his hand over his eyes,
murmured, &ldquo;The falling leaves trouble my rest,&rdquo; and
straight he slumbered again.&nbsp; The knight summoned his
energies for another stroke, again whirled his axe in the air,
and furiously dashed it to the utter destruction of the
giant&rsquo;s scull.&nbsp; The latter merely stirred, and said,
&ldquo;The dropping acorns disturb my sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
knight flung down his <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>axe and fled in despair from an
enemy who held his fiercest blows and his vaunted and well-tried
might but as falling leaves and dropping acorns.&nbsp; Reader, so
do I.&nbsp; My hardest blows shall seem but as leaves and acorns
to the giant with whom I am at war, and would fain destroy.</p>

LONDON MATRIMONIAL.</h2>
<p>Last year 25,924 couples were married in the metropolis.&nbsp;
The Registrar-General tells us the increase of early marriages
chiefly occurs in the manufacturing and mining districts.</p>
<p>In London 2.74 of the men and 12.11 of the women who married
were not of full age.&nbsp; There is an excess of adults in the
metropolis at the marrying ages over 21; and there are not
apparently the same inducements to marry early, as exist in the
Midland counties.</p>
<p>Sir Cresswell Cresswell must have but a poor opinion of
matrimony.&nbsp; At the very moment of my writing, I am told
there are six hundred divorce cases in arrear; that is, after the
hundreds whose chains he has loosened, there are, it appears,
already twelve hundred more of injured wives and husbands eager
to be free.&nbsp; The evil, such as it is, will extend
itself.&nbsp; Under the old system there was, practically
speaking, no redress, and a man and woman tied together would
endeavour to <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>make the best of it; now, if they
feel the more they quarrel and disagree with each other, the
better chance they have of being at liberty, it is to be feared,
in some cases, husband and wife will not try so heartily to
forget and forgive, as husbands and wives ought to do.&nbsp; I do
not say there ought not to be liberty, where all love has long
since died out, and been followed by bad faith and cruelty, and
neglect.&nbsp; I believe there should be, and that the Divorce
Act was an experiment imperatively required.&nbsp; Where mutual
love has been exchanged for mutual hate, it is hard that human
law should bind together, in what must be life-long
misery&mdash;misery perhaps not the less intense that it has
uttered no word of complaint, made no sign, been unsuspected by
the world, yet all the while dragging its victim to an early or
premature grave.&nbsp; But human nature is a poor weak thing, and
many a silly man or silly woman may think that Sir Cresswell
Cresswell may prove a healing physician, when their malady was
more in themselves than they cared to believe.&nbsp; I hear of
one case where a lady having &pound;15,000 a-year in her own
right, has run off with her footman.&nbsp; Would she have done
that if there had been no Sir Cresswell?&nbsp; I fancy not.&nbsp;
Again, another married lady, with &pound;100,000 settled on her,
runs off with the curate.&nbsp; Had it not occurred to her that
Sir Cresswell Cresswell would, in due time, dissolve her union
with her legitimate lord, and enable her to follow the bent of
her passions, would she not have fought with them, and in the
conquest of them <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>won more true peace for herself,
than she can ever hope for now?&nbsp; I believe so.&nbsp; In the
long commerce of a life, there must be times, when we may think
of others we have known, when we may idly fancy we should have
been happier with others; but true wisdom will teach us that it
is childish to lament after the event, that it were wiser to take
what comfort we can find, and that, after all, it is duty, rather
than happiness, that should be the pole-star of life.&nbsp;
Southey told Shelley a man might be happy with any woman, and
certainly a wise man, once married, will try to make the best of
it.&nbsp; But to return to Sir Cresswell Cresswell, I wish that
he could give relief without stirring up such a pool of stinking
mud.&nbsp; Who is benefitted by the disgusting details?&nbsp; It
is a fine thing for the penny papers.&nbsp; They get a large
sale, and so reap their reward.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i>, also, is
generally not very backward when anything peculiarly revolting
and indecent is to be told; but are the people, high or low, rich
or poor, the better?&nbsp; I find it hard to believe they
are.&nbsp; How husbands can be false, how wives can intrigue, how
servants can connive, we know, and we do not want to hear it
repeated.&nbsp; If Prior&rsquo;s Chloe was an ale-house drab, if
the Clara of Lord Bolingbroke sold oranges in the Court of
Requests, if Fielding kept indifferent company, we are amused or
grieved, but still learn something of genius, even from its
errors; but of the tribe Smith and Brown I care not to
hear&mdash;ever since the Deluge the Smiths and Browns have been
much the same.&nbsp; What am I the better for <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>learning
all the rottenness of domestic life?&nbsp; Is that fit reading
for the family circle?&nbsp; I suppose the newspapers think it
is, but I cannot come to that opinion.&nbsp; Can it have a
wholesome effect on the national feeling?&nbsp; Can it heighten
the reverence for Nature&rsquo;s primary ordinance of
matrimony?</p>
<p>In the Book of Common Prayer I read that matrimony is
&ldquo;holy;&rdquo; that it was instituted of God in the time of
man&rsquo;s innocency, signifying unto us the mystical union that
is between Christ and his Church, which holy estate Christ
adorned and beautified with his presence and first miracle that
he wrought in Cana of Galilee; and is commended of St. Paul to be
honourable among all men, and, therefore, is not by any to be
enterprised, &ldquo;nor taken in hand unadvisedly, lightly, or
wantonly, to satisfy men&rsquo;s carnal lusts or appetites, like
brute beasts that have no understanding; but reverently,
discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God, duly
considering the causes for which matrimony was
ordained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas! our age is not a marrying age; and, therefore, I fear it
is an unholy one: neither our young men nor our young maidens
honestly fall in love and marry now-a-days.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know that the Registrar-General&rsquo;s report says such.&nbsp; I
know that many of his marriages are affairs of convenience;
unions of businesses, or thousands, or broad lands; not marriages
&ldquo;holy,&rdquo; in the sense of the prayer-book and of
God.&nbsp; A man who marries simply for love, exposes himself to
ridicule; the modern ingenuous youth is not so green as all that;
if <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>he marries at all, it must be an heiress, or, at any
rate, one well dowered.&nbsp; The last thing your modern
well-bred beauty does, is to unite her fate with that of a man in
the good old-fashioned way.&nbsp; She has learnt to set her heart
upon the accidents of life,&mdash;the fine house, the
establishment; and if these she cannot have, she will even die an
old maid.&nbsp; The real is sacrificed to the imaginary; the
substance, to the shadow; the present, to the morrow that never
comes.&nbsp; A man says he will become rich; he will sacrifice
everything to that; and the chances are he becomes poor in heart
and purse.&nbsp; The maiden&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>With the meek brown eyes,<br />
In whose orb a shadow lies,<br />
Like the dusk in evening skies&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>loses all her divinity, and pines away, and becomes what I
care not to name; and the world&mdash;whose wisdom is
folly&mdash;sanctions all this.&nbsp; It calls it prudence,
foresight.&nbsp; A man has no business to marry till he can keep
a wife, is the cuckoo cry; which would have some meaning if a
wife was a horse or a dog, and not an answer to a human need, and
an essential to success in life.&nbsp; The world forgets that man
is not an automaton, but a being fearfully and wonderfully
framed.&nbsp; No machine, but a lyre responsive to the breath of
every passing passion: now fevered with pleasure; now toiling for
gold; anon seeking to build up a lofty fame; and that the more
eager and passionate and daring he is&mdash;the more eagle is his
eye, and the loftier his aim, the more he needs woman&mdash;<!--
page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>the comforter and the helpmeet&mdash;by his side.&nbsp;
Our fathers did not ignore this, and they succeeded.&nbsp;
Because the wife preserved them from the temptations of life;
because she, with her words and looks of love, assisted them to
bear the burdens and fight the battles of life; because she stood
by her husband&rsquo;s side as his helpmeet; bone of his bone,
flesh of his flesh; soothing each sorrow; aiding each upward aim:
it was thus they became great; and it is because we do not thus,
we pale before them.&nbsp; It is not good for man to be
alone.&nbsp; Man has tried to disobey the divine law, and lived
alone; and what has been the result?&mdash;even when tried by men
of superior sanctity, as in the case of the Romish Church, has
the world gained in happiness or morality?&nbsp; I trow
not.&nbsp; Take the limited experience of our own age, and
fathers and mothers know, to their bitter cost, I am right.&nbsp;
The manhood, brave and generous, much of it wrecked in our great
cities, will bear me out.&nbsp; But matrimony is more than
this.&nbsp; It spite of the hard matter-of-fact, sceptical, and
therefore sensual character of the passing day, will it not be
confessed that the union of man and woman, as husband and wife,
is the greatest earthly need, and is followed by the greatest
earthly good?&nbsp; Unhappy marriages there may be; imprudent
ones there may be; but such are not the rule; and very properly
our legislators have agreed to give relief in such cases.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nature never did betray the soul that loved her;&rdquo;
and nature tells men and women to marry.&nbsp; Just as the young
man is entering upon life&mdash;just as he comes to independence
<!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>and man&rsquo;s estate&mdash;just as the crisis of his
being is to be solved, and it is to be seen whether he decide
with the good, and the great, and the true, or whether he sink
and be lost for ever, Matrimony gives him ballast and a right
impulse.&nbsp; Of course it can&rsquo;t make of a fool a
philosopher; but it can save a fool from being foolish.&nbsp; War
with nature and she takes a sure revenge.&nbsp; Tell a young man
not to have an attachment that is virtuous, and he will have one
that is vicious.&nbsp; Virtuous love&mdash;the honest love of a
man for the woman he is about to marry, gives him an anchor for
his heart; something pure and beautiful for which to labour and
live; and the woman, what a purple light it sheds upon her path;
it makes life for her no day-dream; no idle hour; no painted
shadow; no passing show; but something real, earnest, worthy of
her heart and head.&nbsp; But most of us are cowards and dare not
think so; we lack grace; we are of little faith; our inward eye
is dim and dark.&nbsp; The modern young lady must marry in style;
the modern young gentleman marries a fortune.&nbsp; But in the
meanwhile the girl grows into an old maid, and the youth takes
chambers&mdash;ogles at nursery-maids and becomes a man about
town&mdash;a man whom it is dangerous to ask into your house, for
his business is intrigue.&nbsp; The world might have had a happy
couple; instead, it gets a woman fretful, nervous, fanciful, a
plague to all around her.&nbsp; He becomes a sceptic in all
virtue; a corrupter of the youth of both sexes; a curse in
whatever domestic circle he penetrates.&nbsp; Even worse may <!--
page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>result.&nbsp; She may be deceived, and may die of a
broken heart.&nbsp; He may rush from one folly to another;
associate only with the vicious and depraved; bring disgrace and
sorrow on himself and all around; and sink into an early
grave.&nbsp; Our great cities show what becomes of men and women
who do not marry.&nbsp; Worldly fathers and mothers advise not to
marry till they can afford to keep a wife, and the boys spend on
a harlot more in six months than would keep a wife six
years.&nbsp; Hence it is, all wise men (like old Franklin)
advocate early marriages; and that all our great men, with rare
exceptions, have been men who married young.&nbsp; Wordsworth had
only &pound;100 a year when he first married.&nbsp; Lord Eldon
was so poor that he had to go to Clare-market to buy sprats for
supper.&nbsp; Coleridge and Southey I can&rsquo;t find had any
income at all when they got married.&nbsp; I question at any time
whether Luther had more than fifty pounds a year.&nbsp; Our
successful men in trade and commerce marry young, like George
Stephenson, and the wife helps him up in the world in more ways
than one.&nbsp; Dr. Smiles, in his little book on Self-Help,
gives us the following anecdote respecting J. Flaxman and his
wife&mdash;&ldquo;Ann Denham was the name of his wife&mdash;and a
cheery, bright-souled, noble woman she was.&nbsp; He believed
that in marrying her he should be able to work with an intenser
spirit; for, like him, she had a taste for poetry and art! and,
besides, was an enthusiastic admirer of her husband&rsquo;s
genius.&nbsp; Yet when Sir Joshua Reynolds&mdash;himself a
bachelor&mdash;met <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Flaxman shortly after his marriage,
he said to him, &lsquo;So, Flaxman, I am told you are married; if
so, sir, I tell you, you are ruined for an artist.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Flaxman went straight home, sat down beside his wife, took her
hand in his, and said, &lsquo;Ann, I am ruined for an
artist.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How so, John?&nbsp; How has it
happened?&nbsp; And who has done it?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It
happened,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;in the church; and Ann Denham
has done it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then told her of Sir Joshua&rsquo;s
remark&mdash;whose opinion was well known, and has been often
expressed, that if students would excel they must bring the whole
powers of their mind to bear upon their art from the moment they
rise until they go to bed; and also, that no man could be a great
artist, unless he studied the grand works of Raffaelle, Michael
Angelo, and others, at Rome and Florence.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
I,&rsquo; said Flaxman, drawing up his little figure to its full
height, &lsquo;I would be a great artist.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And
a great artist you shall be,&rsquo; said his wife, &lsquo;and
visit Rome, too, if that be really necessary to make you
great.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But how?&rsquo; asked Flaxman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Work and economise,&rsquo; rejoined his brave wife:
&lsquo;I will never have it said that Ann Denham ruined John
Flaxman for an artist.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so it was determined by
the pair that the journey to Rome was to be made when their means
would admit.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will go to Rome,&rsquo; said Flaxman,
&lsquo;and show the President that wedlock is for man&rsquo;s
good rather than for his harm, and you, Ann, shall accompany
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He kept his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By forbidding our young men and maidens matrimony, <!-- page

blast humanity in its very dawn.&nbsp; Fathers, you say you teach

worldly-wise and clever son is already ruined for life.&nbsp; You

wretched worldly-wisdom taught him to avoid the snare of marrying
young; and soon, if he is not involved in embarrassments which

BREACH OF PROMISE CASES.</h2>
<p>Every now and then, while the courts sit at Westminster, the
general public derives an immense amount of entertainment from
what are described as breach of promise cases.&nbsp; It is true
there is a wonderful sameness about them.&nbsp; The defendant is
amorous, and quotes a great deal of poetry.&nbsp; The court
vastly enjoys the perusal of his letters, and the papers quote
them entire and unabridged.&nbsp; The lady suffers much, and the
public sympathies are decidedly with her.&nbsp; Of course there
are some atrocious cases, for which the men who figure in them
cannot be punished too severely; but as a rule, we do think the
men have the worst of it.&nbsp; A young man is thrown into the
company of an attractive young female; they both have little to
do at the time, and naturally fall in love.&nbsp; She has as much
to do with the matter as he, and yet, if he begins to think that
he cannot keep a wife&mdash;that the marriage will not promote
the happiness of the parties concerned&mdash;that the affair was
rash, and had better be broken off&mdash;he is liable to an <!--
page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>action for breach of promise.&nbsp; Such cases are
constantly occurring.&nbsp; The jury being decidedly
romantic&mdash;thinking love in a cottage to be
Elysium&mdash;forgetting the vulgar saying that when poverty
comes in at the door love flys out of the window&mdash;mark their
sense of the enormity of the defendant&rsquo;s conduct in
refusing to make an imprudent marriage, by awarding to the lady
substantial damages.</p>
<p>Now, we can understand how English jurymen&mdash;generally men
with marriageable daughters, can easily make up their minds to
give damages in such cases, but we more than question the
invariable justice of such a course.&nbsp; When affection has
died out, we can conceive no greater curse than a marriage; yet
either that must be effected, or the jury will possibly agree to
damages that may ruin the defendant for life.&nbsp; This we deem
bad, nor do we think that a woman should always have before her
the certainty that the promise given in that state of mind, which
poets describe as brief insanity, an amiable jury will consider
as an equivalent to an I.O.U. to any amount they please.&nbsp; We
do protest against confounding a legal promise to marry with a
promise to pay the bearer on demand &pound;1000.&nbsp; We rather
fear that this distinction is likely to be overlooked, not but
that occasionally an action for breach of promise has a very
happy effect.&nbsp; It serves as a moral lesson to ardent youths
of an amorous disposition.&nbsp; It also furnishes the
broken-hearted and forsaken fair with a dowry, which has been
known to purchase her a husband in almost as <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>good a
state of preservation as the gentleman who was to have borne that
honoured name.&nbsp; All that we find fault with is the number of
such cases.</p>
<p>A gay deceiver is no enviable character for any respectable
man to wear.&nbsp; No man of mental or moral worth would
voluntarily assume it.&nbsp; But a spinster coming to a court of
justice, and saying to the defendant, &ldquo;You have taken my
heart, give me your purse,&rdquo; is no very desirable position
for a woman, though she may have the fortitude and strength of
mind of a Mrs. Caudle herself.&nbsp; At any rate, the legal view
of woman is very different to the poetical one, and for ourselves
we infinitely prefer the latter.&nbsp; The view of the jury is,
that a woman not marrying a man who has evidently no love for
her, or he would not have married another, is to the plaintiff an
injury&mdash;we think it is a happy escape&mdash;and an injury
which deepens as the courtship lengthens.&nbsp; The jury reasons
that the plaintiff, Mary Brown, is as good-tempered a girl as
ever lived&mdash;that provided she could but marry she did not
care who made her his wife.&nbsp; The position of the sexes is
reversed, and the woman sings&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How happy could I be with either,<br />
Were t&rsquo;other dear charmer away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the jury, if Jones had not married Mary Brown,
Jenkins would&mdash;consequently hers is a double loss.&nbsp; So
that if a woman reaches the ripe age of thirty, by this
arithmetic she is more wronged than she would have been had she
been a blooming lass of twenty.&nbsp; In <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the same
manner there is a delicate sliding-scale for defendants in such
cases.&nbsp; A bridegroom well-made and well-to-do has to pay no
end of sovereigns for the damage he has done; while a short time
since, a defendant who had been attacked with paralysis was let
off for &pound;50.&nbsp; Woman, in this view of the case, is as
dangerous as a money-lender or a shark.&nbsp; Byron tells
us&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s love is of man&rsquo;s life a
thing apart&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis woman&rsquo;s whole existence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But our modern juries give us a very different reading.&nbsp;
We prefer, however, to abide by the old.</p>
<p>Most undoubtedly to win the affections of a woman and then
desert her is a crime&mdash;but it is of a character too ethereal
to be touched by human law.&nbsp; If the woman&rsquo;s heart be
shattered by the blow, no amount of money-compensation can heal
the wound, and a woman of much worth and of the least delicacy
would shrink from the publicity such cases generally confer on
all the parties interested in them.&nbsp; But if the principle be
admitted, that disappointment in love can be atoned for by the
possession of solid cash&mdash;if gold can heal the heart wounded
by the fact that its love has been repelled&mdash;that its
confidence has been betrayed&mdash;we do not see why the same
remedy should not be within the reach of man.&nbsp; And yet this
notoriously is not the case.&nbsp; When anything of the sort is
tried the unhappy plaintiff seldom gets more than a farthing
damages.&nbsp; Besides, what upright, honourable man would stoop
for <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>a moment to such a thing; and yet,
in spite of all modern enlightment, we maintain that the injury
of a breach of promise on the part of a woman is as great as that
on the part of a man.&nbsp; In the morning of life men have been
struck down by such disappointments, and through life have been
blasted as the oak by the lightning&rsquo;s stroke.&nbsp; With
his heart gone&mdash;demoralised, the man has lived to take a
fearful revenge for the first offence, possibly to become a cold
cynic&mdash;sceptical of man&rsquo;s honour and woman&rsquo;s
love.&nbsp; Yet breach of promise cases are not resorted to by
men, and we cannot congratulate our fair friends on the fact that
so many of them come into courts of law as plaintiffs in such
cases.&nbsp; Bachelors will fear that, after all, it is true
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by
glare,<br />
And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the result will be that while the more impetuous of us
will commit ourselves at once, and come within the clutches of
law, the more cool and cunning will excite hopes, which deferred
will make sick the heart, and inspire an affection which may
exist but to torment the heart in which it had its birth.&nbsp;
Ay, beneath such mental grief the beauty and blessedness of life
may vanish, never to return, and yet all the while he who did the
deed may defy the power of human law.</p>
<p>Some letters which have recently appeared in the <i>Manchester
Examiner</i> may be taken as evidence that these breach of
promise cases interfere very materially <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>with
marriages.&nbsp; In the immediate neighbourhood of Manchester the
question, Why don&rsquo;t the men propose? appears to have
excited considerable interest.&nbsp; In that busy region men fall
in love and get married, and have families, and are gathered to
their fathers, just as do the rest of her Majesty&rsquo;s
subjects in other parts of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; But it seems
the Lancashire witches are many of them still on their
parent&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Paterfamilias gets anxious.&nbsp;
Deeply revolving the question under the signature of &ldquo;A
Family Man,&rdquo; he sends the following letter to the Editor of
the journal alluded to&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, Your cosmopolitan journal,&rdquo; he writes to the
Editor, &ldquo;must have many readers interested in the question
&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t the men propose?&rsquo;&nbsp; It would be
dangerous to say I have found the entire solution to this enigma,
for fear of disclosing a mare&rsquo;s nest; but I will warrant
that one of the most powerful causes of the shyness of men in
matters matrimonial, is the frequency of breach of promise
prosecutions.&nbsp; A lady may be quite justified in prosecuting
the man who has deceived her, but is she wise in doing so?&nbsp;
Or if acting wisely for herself, does she not lower the character
of her sex?&nbsp; Men think so, depend upon it.&nbsp; Your
wavering, undecided, fastidious bachelor is a great newspaper
reader, and devours breach of promise cases, and after reading
that Miss Tepkins has obtained so many hundred pounds&rsquo;
damages against Mr. Topkins,
soliloquises:&mdash;&lsquo;Humph!&nbsp; It seems, then, that the
best salve for a wounded heart is gold.&nbsp; Bah! women only
marry for a home.&nbsp; It is clear <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>the woman
is the only gainer, else why estimate her disappointment at so
many hundred pounds?&nbsp; She gives a man nothing for his
promise to marry but her heart (if that), and how much is
<i>it</i> worth?&nbsp; What recompense can he get from her should
she steal back the heart she professes to have given him!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take jolly good care I never make a promise of
marriage to a woman (which means a bond for so many hundred or
thousand pounds).&nbsp; No; if I marry, I marry; but catch me
promising.&rsquo;&nbsp; And thus, for fear of being trapped into
committing himself, he avoids the society of women (where he
might learn not only to really love, but to see the sophistry of
his reasoning), and eventually settles down into old
bachelorhood.&nbsp; What do the ladies say to this?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let them think I am a crusty old bachelor.&nbsp;
Heaven forfend!&nbsp; I protest my supreme admiration of the fair
sex, and had better say I am, <span class="smcap">A Family
Man</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unmarried young girl&rdquo; replies: &ldquo;Sir, In
looking over your valuable paper of to-day, I saw a letter
headed, &lsquo;Why do not the men propose?&rsquo; which I read
with great interest, as I found that the writer, although of the
opposite sex, was of the same opinion as myself, in regard to
ladies prosecuting their late lovers for breach of promise of
marriage.&nbsp; I do think it shows in them a mean spirit of
revenge, of which a lady should not be guilty.&nbsp; It certainly
does look as if they thought more of a shelter, a name, and a
ring, than they do of a comfortable home and a loving and
affectionate husband.&nbsp; I do not think it wise of them, as it
must lower themselves <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>and all their sex in the estimation
of the other sex.&nbsp; Besides, it does not speak much of their
love for their lovers, for you know love hides many faults.&nbsp;
I have never been deceived by any man, and I hope I never may,
but the best advice I can give to my poor deceived sisters is to
try and forget their faithless swains, and leave them to the
stings and reflections of their own consciences, which will be a
far greater punishment to them than parting with thousands of
gold and silver.&nbsp; Let them be thankful that they have shown
themselves in their true colours before they had entered on a
life of unhappiness and misery, feeling assured that the man who
could deceive a fond, loving woman is a man of no principle at
all.&nbsp; For my own part, I would scorn the man who ever proved
false to a woman,&mdash;I would not trust him even in
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this condemnation by a woman, let us
trust we shall hear less for the future of breach of promise
cases.</p>

COMMERCIAL LONDON.</h2>
<p>In the Loudon Bankruptcy Court, at times, melancholy
revelations are made&mdash;revelations which, indeed, do
&ldquo;point a moral,&rdquo; though they can hardly be said
&ldquo;to adorn a tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Too generally the
manifestations are the same&mdash;the hastening to be rich, which
to so many has been a snare&mdash;the vulgar attempt to keep up
appearances and impose on the world&mdash;the recklessness and
want of honour and principle which prevail where we should least
have expected it, in the middle classes, who, as the heart and
core of the nation, at times are apt to be too indiscriminately
eulogised.&nbsp; Last week an illustration of what we mean
occurred.&nbsp; It came out in evidence that a bankrupt had goods
from a London wholesale house, not for his legitimate trade, but
merely that, by their sale at less than cost price, funds might
be provided for the passing exigencies of the hour.&nbsp; These
goods were not unpacked, but at once sent up to a London
auctioneer and sold.&nbsp; Nor, it seems, was this an isolated
case&mdash;the custom is a common one; it is but what takes place
<!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>every day.&nbsp; Again, a tradesman is in
difficulties&mdash;he goes to his principal creditor, who says,
&ldquo;Well you must not stop yet&mdash;you must try and reduce
my debt first,&rdquo;&mdash;goods are ordered from Manchester or
Birmingham&mdash;and, perhaps without being unpacked, taken to
the warehouse of the London creditor&mdash;the tradesman then
applies to the Bankruptcy Court, and, as his books are well kept,
a <i>sine qua non</i> with the Commissioners&mdash;and, as the
principal creditor makes things as smooth as possible, the man
gets a first-class certificate and begins again.&nbsp; Bill
discounters tell you of the number of forged bills which pass
through their hands, and which are sure to be taken up when
due.&nbsp; Even the oldest and proudest firms are not free from
shame.&nbsp; My readers need not that I remind them of the
conduct of Gurney, Overend, &amp; Co. with reference to the
forged spelter warrants.&nbsp; A city lawyer, a man of
considerable practice and experience, once assured me he did not
believe there was such a thing as commercial morality&mdash;but
we must hope that he had seen so much of the dark side, as to
forget that there was a bright side at all, but that the true
feeling in the city is not of the highest character is evident if
we recall the sympathy displayed toward the directors of the
Royal British Bank&mdash;and again exhibited in the case of
Strachan and Sir John Dean Paul, or remember the ridiculous
manifestations of the gentlemen of the Stock Exchange and Mincing
Lane, of which Tom Sayers was the embarrassed subject.&nbsp; How
wide-spread was the delirium of the <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>railway
mania&mdash;what rascalities have been laid bare by the bursting
of some of our insurance and other companies.&nbsp; Take that
list just published by Mr. Spachman, Jun., of the losses
sustained by public companies through the inadequate system of
the audit of accounts.&nbsp; The list is short, but not
sweet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Royal British Bank.&mdash;Stopped
payment in 1856.&nbsp; The failure was caused by making advances
to directors and others on improper and insufficient
securities.&nbsp; Capital, &pound;200,000; deposits,
&pound;540,000; on which 15s. in the pound has been returned;
deficiency, 5s. in the pound; &pound;135,000; total,
&pound;335,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tipperary Bank.&mdash;Failure caused by the frauds
of Sadleir.&nbsp; Accounts were wilfully falsified.&nbsp;
Capital, &pound;500,000; deposits, &pound;700,000; total,
&pound;1,200,000.&nbsp; The whole has been lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The London and Eastern Bank.&mdash;In this case the
notorious Colonel Waugh appropriated to himself an amount equal
to the whole paid-up capital of the bank, and has since absconded
and set his creditors at defiance.&nbsp; The loss exceeds
&pound;250,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crystal Palace Company.&mdash;The frauds of Robson,
committed by tampering with the transfer-books, entailed a loss
of &pound;100,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Great Northern Railway
Company.&mdash;Redpath&rsquo;s frauds, committed in a similar
manner to Robson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The auditors here were greatly at
fault, as I understand that dividends were paid on a larger
amount of stock than had been issued.&nbsp; Loss,
&pound;250,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Union Bank of London.&mdash;The frauds just
discovered, committed by the head cashier, William George
Pullinger, by means of a fictitious pass-book, representing the
account between the Union Bank and the Bank of England.&nbsp; The
frauds are said to have extended over a period of five years, and
with a proper check in the audit, ought to have been detected in
the first half-year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>The men who did these things&mdash;the Redpaths, and
Sadleirs, and Colonel Waughs&mdash;were men known and respected,
be it remembered, in London life.</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i> says our law is worthy a nation of
savages.&nbsp; We have a great deal to do yet, just remember the
Hudson testimonial.&nbsp; There were our merchant princes, men of
integrity, of talent, of skill&mdash;men who have made the name
of British merchant a term of honour as far as our flag can
reach.&nbsp; If London wished to reward successful industry, it
might have looked amongst them.&nbsp; In this great city there
was more than one lord of thousands, who came here with hardly a
penny in his pocket, or shoes on his feet.&nbsp; London might
have raised a testimonial to one of them; and had it done so,
every unfledged clerkling and embryo Rothschild would have glowed
as he saw how industry, and wealth, and honour, went hand in
hand.&nbsp; With what delight would the young aspirant for wealth
have returned to the study of those refreshing maxims in ethics
which grandmammas so zealously impress upon the juvenile mind,
and of which the British public are not a little fond.&nbsp; But
a testimonial was given to Mr. Hudson for none of these
things.&nbsp; It was not for honesty, or industry, or worth, that
he was rewarded.&nbsp; It was simply for speculation&mdash;for a
course of conduct utterly hostile to legitimate business, which
has made many a decent tradesman a bankrupt, and which has turned
many an honest man into a knave.&nbsp; England stamped with its
approval a system the morality of which is somewhat
questionable.&nbsp; It bade the young man eschew the dulness <!--
page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>of the counter and the office for the magic wand of
speculation.&nbsp; It passed by the industrious merchant, the
philanthropist, the patriot, to worship the golden calf, as did
the Hebrews of old.</p>
<p>Eighteen hundred years back, on the plains of Palestine,
appeared a carpenter&rsquo;s son, with a divine mission but a
human heart.&nbsp; He preached no cash gospel&mdash;He was no
prophet in the eyes of the rich.&nbsp; He had His
testimonial&mdash;He reaped it in the bad man&rsquo;s deadly
hate.&nbsp; Alas! the Hebrew nature is the true and universal
one.&nbsp; In Mr. Hudson&rsquo;s, there is the testimonial of the
rich&mdash;for the Christ, and those who would follow in His
steps, there is the thorny path and the open tomb.&nbsp; Let us
not imagine that we are one whit better than the Hebrew.&nbsp;
The Hudson testimonial proves a common paternity.&nbsp; Gold has
still more charms than God.&nbsp; As Mr. Bright, if not in so
many words, but in spirit, says, &ldquo;Perish Savoy, rather than
not trade with France,&rdquo; so the London merchant and
tradesman ignore too often honour and conscience, and morality,
for vulgar gain.</p>
<p>It requires great philosophy to get over the effects of City
Life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let any one,&rdquo; says Addison,
&ldquo;behold the kind of faces he meets as soon as he passes
Cheapside Conduit, and you see a deep attention and a certain
feeble sharpness in every countenance; they look attentive, but
their thoughts are engaged on mean purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
feeling is perpetuated.&nbsp; Addison remarks of a gentleman of
vast estate, whose grandfather was a trader, &ldquo;that he is a
very honest gentleman in his <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>principles,
but cannot for his life talk fairly; he is heartily sorry for it,
but he cheats by constitution, and overreaches by
instinct.&rdquo;&nbsp; I heard of such a one the other
day&mdash;A, a city merchant, married his daughter to B.&nbsp; A
proposed that A and B should stock the cellar of the young couple
with vine&mdash;B agreed&mdash;A purchased the wine&mdash;got a
discount&mdash;and charged B full price for his share&mdash;yet A
was rich as Cr&oelig;sus.&nbsp; I have seen this grasping
displayed by city boys.&nbsp; The writer was once accosted by
some little children with a request that he would contribute
something towards a &ldquo;grotto,&rdquo; on his declining any
assistance, he was politely informed that he was no good, as he
had &ldquo;got no money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>London abounds with Montagu Tiggs, and a genuine article of
any kind in any trade, if by any possibility it can be
adulterated, by painful experience we know it, is utterly
impossibly to buy.&nbsp; In trade, words have long ceased to
represent things.&nbsp; We need not dwell at length on the wrong
thus inflicted on the community at large, all feel the minor
evils resulting from such conduct, and occasionally we hear of
sickness induced, or of life lost,&mdash;and for what? merely
that Brown may get an extra farthing on the rascally rubbish he
sells as the genuine article.&nbsp; I fear these are not times in
which we may argue for the abolition of death punishments.&nbsp;
Such things as these sadly teach us that in London commercial
morality is in danger of undergoing gradual
demoralisation&mdash;that we are in danger of becoming absorbed
in the pursuit of material wealth, <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>careless of
the price it may cost&mdash;that our standard of morality is not
now as it ought to be in a city that boasts its Christian life
and light, and that from London the evil circulates all over the
British realm.</p>
<p>In proof of this, we may appeal to the occurrences of every
day.&nbsp; Our great cities are shadowed over by the giant forms
of vice and crime.&nbsp; Like a thick cloud, ignorance, dense and
dark, pervades the land.&nbsp; Ascending higher to the well-to-do
classes, we find bodily comfort to be the great end of life; we
find everything that can conduce to its realization is
understood&mdash;that the priests and ministers of the sensual
are well paid&mdash;that a good cook, like a diamond, has always
value in the market.&nbsp; M. Soyer, as cook, in the Reform Club,
pocketed, we believe, &pound;800 a year.&nbsp; Hood, in the dark
days of his life, when weakened by the fierce struggle with the
world and its wants, became the prey of the spoiler, and would
have died of starvation had not Government granted him a
pension.&nbsp; Many a man, in whose breast genius was a presence
and a power has been suffered to pine and starve; but who ever
heard of a cook dying of starvation?&nbsp; How is it, then, that
such is the case, that so much is done for the body, and so
little for the mind? that at this time the teacher of spiritual
realities can but at best scrape together as much salary as a
lawyer&rsquo;s clerk?&nbsp; We are not speaking now of wealthy
fellows who repose on beds of roses, but of the busy earnest men
who from the pulpit, or the press, or the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
desk, proclaim the morality and truth without which society <!--
page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>would become a mass of corruption and death.&nbsp; How
is it that they are overlooked, and that honour is paid to the
soldier who gives up his moral responsibility, and does the
devil&rsquo;s work upon condition that food and raiment be
granted him&mdash;to mere wealth and rank&mdash;to what is
accidental rather than to what is true and valuable in
life?&nbsp; The truth is our civilization is hardly worthy of the
name?&nbsp; We may say, in the language of Scripture, we have not
attained, neither are we already perfect.&nbsp; We have but just
seen the dim grey of morn, and we boast that we bask in the
sunshine of unclouded day.&nbsp; Our commercial morality brands
our civilization with a voice of thunder, as an imposture and a
sham.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly we are a most thinking, rational, sober, and
religious people.&nbsp; It is a fact upon which we rather pride
ourselves.&nbsp; It is one of which we are firmly convinced, and
respecting which we are apt to become somewhat garrulous, and not
a little dull.&nbsp; On this head we suffer much good-natured
prosing in ourselves and others.&nbsp; Like the Pharisees of old,
we go up into the temple and thank God that we are not
rationalists, like the Germans, or infidels, like the
French.&nbsp; We are neither Turks nor Papists, but, on the
contrary, good honest Christian men.&nbsp; It may be that we are
a little too much given to boasting&mdash;that we are rather too
fond of giving our alms before men&mdash;that when we pray, it is
not in secret and when the door is shut, but where the prayer can
be heard and the devotion admired; but we are what we
are&mdash;and we imagine we get on indifferently well.&nbsp; We
might, possibly, <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>be better&mdash;certainly we might
be worse; but, as it is, we are not particularly dissatisfied,
and have ever, on our faces, a most complacent smirk, testifying
so strongly, to our pleasing consciousness, of the many virtues
we may happen to possess, but in spite of all this we need a
considerable increase and improvement as regards what is called
commercial morality.</p>

LONDON GENTS.</h2>
<p>The newspapers, a few years since, contained an instance of
folly such as we seldom meet with, even in this foolish
generation.&nbsp; Two young men&mdash;gents, we presume&mdash;one
Sunday evening promenading Regent Street, the admired of all
beholders, met two young ladies of equally genteel manners, and
equally fashionable exterior.&nbsp; It is said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Greek meet Greek, then comes the tug
of war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, however, the adage was reversed.&nbsp; The
encounter, so far from being hostile, was friendly in the
extreme.&nbsp; Our gay Lotharios, neither bashful nor prudent,
learned that their fascinating enchantresses were the daughters
of a Count, whose large estates were situated neither in the
moon, nor in the New Atlantic, nor in the &ldquo;golden
Ingies,&rdquo; nor in the lands remote, where a Gulliver
travelled or a Sinbad sailed, but in France itself.&nbsp; That
they had come to England, bringing with them simply their two
hundred pounds a quarter, that they might, in calm
retirement&mdash;without the <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>annoyances
to which their rank, if known, would subject them&mdash;judge for
themselves what manner of men we were.&nbsp; The tale was simple,
strange, yet certainly true.&nbsp; Ladies of charming manners,
and distinguished birth&mdash;young&mdash;lovely&mdash;each with
two hundred pounds a quarter&mdash;cast upon this great Babylon,
without a friend&mdash;no man with the heart of an Englishman
could permit such illustrious strangers to wander unprotected in
our streets.&nbsp; Accordingly an intimacy was
commenced&mdash;letters written behind the counter, but dated
from the Horse Guards, signed as if the composer were a peer of
the realm, were sent in shoals to Foley-place.&nbsp; The result
was, that after our Regent Street heroes were bled till no more
money could be had, the secret was discovered, and they found
themselves, not merely miserably bamboozled, but a laughing-stock
besides.</p>
<p>But this tale has a moral.&nbsp; Ellam&mdash;he of the
ill-spelt letters and the Horse Guards&mdash;was a shopman
somewhere in Piccadilly.&nbsp; No person of any education could
have been taken in by so trumpery a tale.&nbsp; Did the young men
in our shops have time for improvement, could they retire from
business at a reasonable hour, could they be permitted to inform
and strengthen the mind, such a remarkable instance of folly as
that to which we have alluded could not possibly occur.</p>
<p>The gent of the Regent Street style, of whom poor Wright used
to sing to an Adelphi audience, was evidently a very
badly-dressed and ill-bred-fellow in spite of the fact that his
vest was of the last cut, that <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>his tile
was faultless, that his boots were ditto, and that none could
more gracefully</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;puff a cigar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gents of to-day are the same.&nbsp; I was amused by
hearing of a party of them, connected with one of the city
houses, who went into the country one Easter Monday to enjoy
themselves; they did enjoy themselves, as all young fellows
should, thoroughly, but from their enjoyment they were recalled
to a sense of dignity, by a characteristic remark of one of them,
as he saw passers by, &ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;They will think we are retail.&rdquo;&nbsp; A writer in
the <i>Builder</i> remarking the degeneracy of regular cocknies
attributes it to the want of good air, the expensive nature of a
good education, the sedentary employment of many of them.&nbsp;
And no doubt these reasons are the true ones, and of considerable
force.&nbsp; Well might Coleridge anticipate for his son as
prosperous career as compared with his own.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
was reared<br />
In the great city, pent &rsquo;mid cloister dim,<br />
And saw naught lovely but the sky and stars;<br />
But <i>thou</i>, my babe, shall wander in the breeze,<br />
By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags<br />
Of ancient mountains; beneath the clouds<br />
Which image in their arch both lakes and shores,<br />
And mountain crags, so shall thou see and hear<br />
The lovely shapes and sounds unchangeable,<br />
Of that eternal language which thy God utters.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true, and hence, let us judge leniently of the lad
living within the sound of Bow Bells.&nbsp; Nature is <!-- page
161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>the best and truest teacher a man can have&mdash;and it
is little of nature that the cockney sees, or hears, and
feels.&nbsp; He goes to Richmond, but, instead of studying the
finest panorama in the world, he stupifies himself with doubtful
port; he visits the Crystal Palace, but it is for the sake of the
lobster-salad; he runs down to Greenwich, not to revel in that
park, beautiful still in spite of the attacks of London on its
purity, but to eat white-bait; he takes, it may be, the rail or
the steamboat to Gravesend, but merely that he may dance with
milliners at Tivoli.&nbsp; The only idea of a garden to a London
gent, is a place where there is dancing, and drinking, and
smoking going on.&nbsp; And this is a type of his inbred
depravity.&nbsp; He has no rational amusements.&nbsp; In the
winter time shut up the casinos, and do away with the half-price
at the theatres, and the poor fellow is <i>hors de combat</i>,
and has nothing left him but suicide or delirium tremens.&nbsp;
Literary and Scientific Institutions don&rsquo;t answer in
London&mdash;even a place like the Whittington Club, where any
respectable young man belonging to the middle classes may find a
home, is by no means (so I have understood) a success.</p>
<p>Tom Moore says there is not in the world so stupid or boorish
a congregation as the audience of an English play-house.&nbsp; I
fear there is some truth in this as regards London.&nbsp; The
regular cockney is not a fine sample of the genus homo, in the
first place he is very conceited, and when a man is that, it is
little that will do him good; in the second place, he thinks only
of business and pleasure, he lives well, dresses well, goes to
church once <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>on the Sunday, and laughs at
new-fangled opinions, and wonders why people grumble, and
believes all he reads in the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; If you want to
start any successful agitation you must begin it in the
provinces.&nbsp; The Anti-Corn Law League had its seat at
Manchester, the Reform agitation had its head quarters at
Birmingham.&nbsp; The wisest thing done by the United
Kingdom-Alliance, was to plant themselves in Manchester rather
than in London.&nbsp; Sydney Smith said it required a severe
surgical operation to make a Scotchman understand a joke, it is
almost as difficult to get a Londoner to understand anything new;
he is slow to recognise worth or virtue, and if any of his own
connection rise, he exclaims, with the writing-master, who would
not believe Newton was a good mathematician, &ldquo;the fool, he
is an hour over a sum in the rule of three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth is we are a city of shopkeepers; and if intellectual
pursuits be denied to those engaged in trade, the consequence
must be the popular opinion must be that of those who know little
else than the business of the shop, and as a consequence a curse
will go forth to the remotest corner of the land.&nbsp; Bigotry,
prejudice, falsehood, and passion will be rampant and rife, and
truth and reason will be trampled under foot.&nbsp; Just as
manhood is forming, just as the moral and intellectual parts of
our nature are developing themselves, just as life becomes a
reality, and glimpses of the work to be done, and of the
blessedness of doing it, catch and charm the youthful eye, the
victim is compelled to stand <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>behind the
counter, and is threatened with beggary if he fail practically to
remember that the pursuit of money, to the utter exclusion of
aught higher and nobler, is the end for which life is given
man.&nbsp; No wonder such a system fearfully avenges
itself&mdash;that the sensual is exalted&mdash;that we meet so
little in accordance with principle and truth.&nbsp; Debarred
from intellectual pursuits, what awaits our young men but
frivolous excitement?&nbsp; Ignorant, with the feelings of our
common nature unnaturally aroused&mdash;with minds enfeebled by
lack of healthy exercise&mdash;our middle class&mdash;the class
perhaps the most important in our land&mdash;stands by society in
its conventionalism and falsehood and wrong, and we mourn and
sigh over giant ills, that we cannot grapple with effectually
because we go the wrong way to work.</p>
<p>A great want of our age is education for the middle
classes.&nbsp; We want to have them taught to believe in
something else than the shop or the desk.&nbsp; We want them to
believe the mind as fully entitled to their care as the body, and
the money-bag but poor and impotent compared with the well-spent
life.&nbsp; We would publish the all-important truth&mdash;a
truth that shall live and fructify when the great city in which
we write shall have become a desert-waste&mdash;the truth that
man was made in the image of his maker, and that the heart that
beats within is capable of divinity itself.&nbsp; We may have
drawn in dark colours our national state.&nbsp; We fear the
picture is but too true; and that till something be done to burst
the bonds of habit, and educate the youth in our shops, <!-- page
164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>the picture will continue to be true.&nbsp; We write
not to deprecate the land of our birth; it is one dear to us by
every remembrance of the past and hope for the future.&nbsp;
Because we thus cling to it do we deplore and expose what we deem
to be wrong, and that our social condition may be healthy, that
our civilization may be complete that our faith may be a living
leavening power, do we ask the emancipation of the sons and
daughters of trade&mdash;that that long-looked-for hour may
quickly come.</p>

THE LONDON VOLUNTEERS.</h2>
<p>In spite of Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s injudicious attempt to
check the rifle movement in its infancy, there can be no doubt
now but that it is a complete success.&nbsp; The appeal to the
martial spirit&mdash;more or less strong in the hearts of all
Englishmen&mdash;has been most cheerfully responded to.&nbsp;
Something of the kind was evidently required to excite the
energies and to occupy the leisure hours of our numerous
youth.&nbsp; We are always in danger of becoming too peaceable a
folk.&nbsp; Our avocations, all of a mercantile or professional
character,&mdash;our amusements, less out-door, and more
sedentary, than ought to be the case,&mdash;the very humane
spirit which pervades all English society,&mdash;our enormous
wealth; all tend to make us peaceably disposed.&nbsp; None can be
alarmed at our warlike demonstrations.&nbsp; No nation in Europe
need fear a British invasion.&nbsp; No foreign government can
possibly pretend that the British government harbours designs of
active hostility against any European power.&nbsp; Indeed, the
naturally and necessarily peaceful intentions of this country are
candidly <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>acknowledged by the most eminent men
in France itself.&nbsp; Michel Chevalier, in his account of a
recent visit to this country, has done ample justice to our
moderation, and to our desire to be at peace with all the
world.</p>
<p>We may, then, view the increase of our volunteer riflemen
without any alarm&mdash;nay, rather with a considerable amount of
pleasure.&nbsp; People connected with fast life, tell us that the
falling off of the attendance of young men at the casinos is
something very remarkable; the reason of this is attributed to
the fact that they are engaged and interested in their
drill.&nbsp; It is with unmixed satisfaction, that we see, day by
day, the long columns of the <i>Times</i> filled with the names
of the towns which have just joined the movement, and the
proceedings of those which already possess a corps of
riflemen.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> tells us, that already the force
thus raised consists of 170,000, of whom half nearly are
Londoners; but the movement, we trust, will continue to be
developed for some time to come.&nbsp; Every young man should
join it, as it gives him healthy recreation, soldier-like habits,
and a feeling that he is a son of our common mother&mdash;fine
Old England, the land of the brave and the free.&nbsp; We are
much in the habit of doing our work by proxy.&nbsp; Shareholders,
in companies, leave the management to a few directors, and learn,
too late, to curse their folly.&nbsp; Institutions of the most
excellent character, in the hands of a few become perverted, and
are often real stumbling-blocks in the way of reform.&nbsp; So it
is with our army and navy.&nbsp; We pay for them handsomely, we
intrust their <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>management to a few, and then we
wake up to find that we have been trusting on a broken reed; that
our guns, and muskets, are old-fashioned; that routine and
favouritism in office are more than a match for the cleverest of
officers and the bravest of men; and that we have almost all our
work to begin over again.&nbsp; Now, one great advantage of the
rifle movement is that it throws us back upon
ourselves&mdash;that it teaches us all to feel that we have a
personal stake in the defence of the country&mdash;that it
recalls the martial energy which we are fast in danger of losing,
and makes all panic-fear for the future impossible.&nbsp; Surely,
also, the moral effect of all this on Europe must be great.&nbsp;
The nation that arms itself is always respected.&nbsp; It is the
French army that makes the name of the French Emperor so famous
in all parts of the world.&nbsp; Again, the nation that is always
protected is safe from attack.&nbsp; People do not go to war with
strong states, but weak ones.&nbsp; In the fable, the wolf
quarrels not with the wolf, but the lamb.&nbsp; It ought not to
be so, we freely admit; but we must take the world as we find it,
and act accordingly.&nbsp; And the <i>morale</i> of all history
is that there is no such safeguard of peace as the knowledge that
a nation has set its house in order, and is thoroughly prepared
for war.</p>
<p>Look back at the olden time, when we triumphed at Agincourt,
Cressy, and Poictiers&mdash;when we won for England her foremost
place among the nations of earth.&nbsp; A writer in the
<i>Cambridge Chronicle</i> has collected all that he can find
relative to &ldquo;<i>The Longbow of the past</i>, <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span><i>the Rifle of the future</i>,&rdquo; and done good
service by its republication under the title already given.</p>
<p>There is a muster-roll of the army of Henry V. preserved among
Rymer&rsquo;s unprinted collection in the British Museum.&nbsp;
The Earl of Cambridge appears in it with a personal retinue of 2
knights, 57 esquires, and 100 horse archers.&nbsp; The Duke of
Clarence brought in his retinue 1 earl, 2 bannerets, 14 knights,
222 esquires, and 720 horse archers.&nbsp; The roll includes
2,536 men-at-arms, 4,128 horse archers, 38 arblesters
(cross-bowmen), 120 miners, 25 master gunners, 50 servitor
gunners, a stuffer of bacinets, 12 armourers, 3 kings of
arms.&nbsp; A Mr. Nicholas Colnet, a physician, also brought 3
archers, 20 surgeons, an immense retinue of labourers, artisans,
fletchers, bowyers, wheelwrights, chaplains, and minstrels.&nbsp;
Foot-archers were not enumerated, but the total number of
effective soldiers amounted to 10,731.&nbsp; These were the men
who gained the field at Agincourt.&nbsp; Philip de Comines
acknowledged that English archery excelled that of every other
nation, and Sir John Fortesque states &ldquo;that the might of
the Realme of England standyth upon archers.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
reign of Henry II. the English conquests in Ireland were
principally owing, it is recorded, to the use of the long
bow.&nbsp; The victory gained over the Scots, by Edward I., in
1298, at the great battle of Falkirk, was chiefly won by the
power of the English bowmen.&nbsp; In 1333 Edward III., with
small loss, gained a signal victory at Halidown Hill, near
Berwick, when attacked by the Scots under the Earl of <!-- page
169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>Douglas.&nbsp; Speed gives, from Walsingham, the
following description of the battle:&mdash;&ldquo;The chief feat
was wrought by the English archers, who first with their stiff,
close, and cruel storms of arrows made their enemies&rsquo;
footmen break; and when the noble Douglas descended to the charge
with his choicest bands, himself being in a most rich and
excellently tempered armour, and the rest singularly
well-appointed,&mdash;the Lord Percy&rsquo;s archers making a
retreat did withal deliver their deadly arrows so lively, so
courageously, so grievously, that they ran through the
men-at-arms, bored the helmets, beat their lances to the earth,
and easily shot those who were more slightly armed through and
through.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gibbon notes the singular dread with which
the English archers filled their enemies in the crusades, and
states, &ldquo;that at one time Richard, with seventeen knights
and 300 archers, sustained the charge of the whole Turkish and
Saracen army.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the reign of Richard II., in 1377,
the Isle of Wight was invaded by the French, who landed in great
force at Franche-Ville (called afterwards Newtown), which they
destroyed, and then directed their march to Carisbrooke Castle,
for the purpose of taking that stronghold.&nbsp; The news of the
invasion soon spread throughout the island, and no time was lost
in mustering the forces which it possessed.&nbsp; These forces
consisted chiefly of archers, who so admirably posted themselves
in ambush, that they rendered a good account of the advanced
division of the French.&nbsp; The other division of the enemy had
commenced an attack on Carisbrooke <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>Castle,
when the victorious archers advanced to its relief, and soon
cleared the island of the intruders.&nbsp; The battle of
Shrewsbury, in 1403, was one of the most desperate encounters
ever seen in England.&nbsp; The archers on both sides did
terrible execution.&nbsp; Henry IV. and the Prince of Wales on
one side, and Earl Douglas with Henry Hotspur, son of the Earl of
Northumberland, on the other, performed prodigies of
valour.&nbsp; At length, Hotspur being slain and Douglas taken,
Henry remained master of the field.</p>
<p>The bow was the most ancient and universal of all
weapons.&nbsp; Our ancestors in this island, at a very early
period of their history, used the bow, like other nations, for
two purposes.&nbsp; In time of peace it was an implement for
hunting and pastime; and in time of war it was a formidable
weapon of offence and defence.&nbsp; It was not till after the
battle of Hastings that our Anglo-Saxon forefathers learned
rightly to appreciate the merit of the bow and the cloth-yard
shaft.&nbsp; Though a general disarming followed that event, the
victor allowed the vanquished Saxon to carry the bow.&nbsp; The
lesson taught by the superiority of the Norman archers was not
forgotten.&nbsp; From that period the English archers began to
rise in repute, and in course of time proved themselves, by their
achievements in war, both the admiration and terror of their
foes, and excelled the exploits of other nations.&nbsp; The great
achievements of the English bowmen, which shed lustre upon the
annals of the nation, extended over a period of more than five
centuries, many <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>years after the invention and use of
firearms.&nbsp; All the youth and manhood of the yeomanry of
England were engaged in the practice of the long bow.&nbsp;
England, therefore, in those times possessed a national voluntary
militia, of no charge to the government, ready for the field on a
short notice, and well skilled in the use of weapons.&nbsp; Hence
sprung the large bodies of efficient troops which at different
periods of English history, in an incredibly short time, were
found ready for the service of their country.&nbsp; These men
were not a rude, undisciplined rabble, but were trained,
disciplined men, every one sufficiently master of his weapon to
riddle a steel corslet at five or six score paces; or, in a body,
to act with terrific effect against masses of cavalry; while most
of them could bring down a falcon on the wing by a bird-bolt, or,
with a broad arrow, transfix the wild deer in the chase.&nbsp;
There is little at the present day in England to afford any
adequate idea of the high importance, the great skill, and the
distinguished renown of the English archers.&nbsp; Some few
places still retain names which tell us where the bowmen used to
assemble for practice,&mdash;as <i>Shooter&rsquo;s Hill</i>,
<i>in Kent</i>; <i>Newington Butts</i>, <i>near London</i>; and
<i>St. Augustine&rsquo;s Butts</i>, <i>near Bristol</i>.&nbsp;
Many of the noble and county families of Great Britain and
Ireland have the symbols of archery charged on their escutcheons;
as, for instance, the Duke of Norfolk, on his bend, between six
crosslets, bears an escutcheon charged with a demi-lion pierced
in the mouth with an arrow, within a double tressure flory and
counterflory.&nbsp; <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>This was an addition to the coat of
his Grace&rsquo;s ancestor, the Earl of Surrey, who commanded at
Flodden Field, in 1513.&nbsp; There are also existing families
which have derived their surnames from the names of the different
crafts formerly engaged in the manufacture of the bow and its
accompaniments; as, for instance, the names of <i>Bowyer</i>,
<i>Fletcher</i>, <i>Stringer</i>, <i>Arrowsmith</i>,
&amp;c.&nbsp; If we refer to our language, there will be found
many phrases and proverbial expressions drawn from or connected
with archery; some suggesting forethought and caution, as
&ldquo;<i>Always have two strings to your bow</i>;&rdquo; it
being the custom of military archers to take additional
bowstrings with them into the field of battle; &ldquo;<i>Get the
shaft-hand of your adversaries</i>;&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Draw not thy
bow before thy arrow be fixed</i>;&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Kill two
birds with one shaft</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; To make an enemy&rsquo;s
machinations recoil upon himself, they expressed by saying,
&ldquo;<i>To outshoot a man in his own bow</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
reference to a vague, foolish guess, they used to say,
&ldquo;<i>He shoots wide of his mark</i>;&rdquo; and of
unprofitable, silly conversation, &ldquo;<i>A fool&rsquo;s bolt
is soon shot</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The unready and the unskilful
archer did not escape the censure and warning of his fellows,
although he might be a great man, and boast that he had
&ldquo;<i>A famous bow&mdash;but it was up at the
castle</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of such they satirically remarked that
&ldquo;<i>Many talked of Robin Hood</i>, <i>who never shot in his
bow</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our ancestors also expressed liberality of
sentiment, and their opinion that merit belonged exclusively to
no particular class or locality, by the following pithy
expressions, &ldquo;<i>Many a good bow besides one </i><!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span><i>in Chester</i>;&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>An archer is
known by his aim</i>, <i>and not by his arrows</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what was the result of all this practice with the
bow?&mdash;why, that we never feared invasion.&nbsp; Those were
not times when old ladies were frightened out of their
night&rsquo;s sleep.&nbsp; Every Englishman was a free and
fearless soldier; the foe might growl at a distance, but he never
dared to touch our shores&mdash;to plunder our cities&mdash;to
massacre our smiling babes&mdash;and to do outrage worse than
death to our English womanhood; and so it will be seen now that
the bow has been superseded by the rifle, when our young lads of
public spirit respond to Tennyson&rsquo;s patriotic appeal,
&ldquo;Form, Riflemen, form!&rdquo;</p>

CRIMINAL LONDON.</h2>
<p>A <i>brochure</i> of fifty pages, full of figures and tables,
just issued, contains the criminal statistics of the metropolis,
as shown by the police returns.&nbsp; It is not very pleasant
reading, in any sense, but it no doubt has its value.&nbsp; We
learn from it that last year the police took into custody 64,281
persons, of whom 29,863 were discharged by the magistrates,
31,565 summarily disposed of, and 2,853 committed for trial; of
the latter number 2,312 were convicted, the rest being either
acquitted or not prosecuted, or in their cases true bills were
not found.&nbsp; About twenty years ago, in 1839, the number
taken into custody rather exceeded that of last year, being
65,965; although since that period 135 parishes, hamlets, and
liberties, with, in 1850, a population of 267,267, have been
added to the metropolitan district, and although the entire
population must have greatly increased in the interval.&nbsp;
These returns exhibits strange variations in the activity of the
police; while last year the apprehensions were, as stated,
64,281, in 1857 they amounted <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>to as much
as 79,364.&nbsp; The difference is 15,000, and of that number in
excess, not one-half were convicted, either summarily or after
trial, the rest forming an excess in the whole of those
discharged by the magistrates.&nbsp; It is a striking fact that
nearly half the number of all whom the police take into custody
are discharged, so that the discrimination of the police is far
from being on a par with its activity.</p>
<p>Criminal London spends some considerable part of its time at
Newgate, Clerkenwell, Wandsworth, Hollowway, and other
establishments well-known to fame, and descriptions of which are
familiar to the reader, but a favourite resort, also, is Portland
Goal, which, by the kindness of Captain Clay, we were permitted,
recently, to inspect.&nbsp; Portland Goal is situated on a neck
of land near Weymouth.</p>
<p>To reach it, the better way is to take a passage in one of the
numerous steamers which ply between Weymouth and Portland.&nbsp;
In half an hour you will find yourself at the bottom of the chalk
hill on which the prison is built.&nbsp; If you are sound in
limb, and not deficient in wind, in another half hour you will
find yourself at the principal entrance of the goal.&nbsp; But to
get at the Prison is no easy work.&nbsp; The Captain of the
steamer will tell you, you must take a trap the moment you get on
shore, but Jehu will ask you so long a price as to put all idea
of riding quite out of the question.&nbsp; The people on the
island will give you but little information, and that of rather a
contradictory <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>character.&nbsp; Undoubtedly the
better plan is to trust to your own sense and legs.&nbsp; On our
way we met an officer of the Royal Navy&mdash;a captain, we
imagine.&nbsp; Before us, at a little distance, was what we took
to be the prison, but we were not sure of the fact, and
accordingly asked the gallant officer.&nbsp; We trust he was not
a type of the service.&nbsp; He did not know what that building
was before him: he did not know whether there was a prison there;
and then he finished by asking us if we were one of the
officials.&nbsp; If the French do come, let us hope Her
Majesty&rsquo;s fleet will have more acute officers than our
gallant acquaintance!&nbsp; We arrived at the principal entrance,
notwithstanding the non-success of our queries with the brave
marine, at a quarter to one.&nbsp; Before we enter, let us look
around.&nbsp; What a place for a man to get braced up in!&nbsp;
What a jolly thing it would be for many a London Alderman could
he come here for a few months.&nbsp; Just below is the prison,
clean, snug, and warm.&nbsp; At our feet is the stupendous
Breakwater, within which lie, as we trust they may ever lie, idle
and secure, some of the ships comprising the Channel Fleet.&nbsp;
Here, stealing into the bay like a bird with white wings, is a
convict ship, coming to bear away to the Bermudas some of the
convicts now shut up within those stone walls.&nbsp; If you look
well at her through the glass you can see her live freight on
board, for she only calls here for some fifty or
sixty,&mdash;who, however, have no wish to leave Portland for
harder work and a less healthy climate.&nbsp; Beyond is <!-- page
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Weymouth, and its comfortable hotels&mdash;its
agreeable promenade&mdash;and with, in summer time, its pleasant
bathing.&nbsp; Right across St. Albyn&rsquo;s Head, and on the
other side the Dorset coast, and straight across some eighty
miles of the salt sea, is Cherbourg, with a breakwater far more
formidable than that above which we stand.&nbsp; It is a clear
bright sky above us, and in the light of the sun the scene is
beautiful almost as one of fairy land.</p>
<p>We ring the bell&mdash;hand in, through a window, our letter
of introduction&mdash;are ushered into a wooden cage in which the
janitor sits&mdash;enter our name in a book, and sit down.&nbsp;
The officers, consisting of about 160 men, exclusive of a small
guard of soldiers, are coming in from dinner.&nbsp; In appearance
they somewhat resemble our Coast-guard, are tall fine men, with
very red faces, and big black bushy whiskers.&nbsp; The principal
warden came to receive us; he has been here ever since the place
has been opened, and we could not have had a better guide, or one
more competent to explain to us the nature of the important works
carried on.&nbsp; And now we have passed into the very prison
itself, and stand surrounded by men who have committed almost
every species of crime.&nbsp; There are some fifteen hundred of
them here from all parts of England; stupid peasants from Suffolk
and Norfolk, and clever rascals (these latter are very
troublesome) from London, and Birmingham, and Liverpool, and
other busy centres of industry, and intelligence, and life.&nbsp;
Says our informant, <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>We have a good many captains in the
army here, and several merchants, nor are we surprised at the
information.</p>
<p>When we entered, the men had just dined, and were collected in
the yard previous to being examined and walked off in gangs,
under the charge of their respective officers, to work.&nbsp; The
gangs consisted of various numbers, of from fifteen to thirty;
each officer felt each man, to see that nothing was hidden, and
examined his number to see that it was all right, and as each
gang marches through the gate, the officer calls out the number
of the gang, and the number of men it contains, to the chief
officer, who enters it in his book.&nbsp; As soon as this
operation was over, the gangs marched out, some to quarry stones
for the Breakwater below; and others, by far the larger number,
to construct the enormous barricades and fortifications which the
Government has ordered as a defence for that part of the
world.&nbsp; The prisoners who cannot stand this hard work are
employed in mending clothes, in making shoes, in baking, and
brewing, in the school-room, and other offices necessary in such
an enormous establishment.&nbsp; In this latter employment no
less a personage than Sir John Dean Paul had been occupied till
very recently.&nbsp; The scene was a busy one; all around us were
convicts&mdash;here quarrying, there employed in the manufacture
of tools, or in carpenters&rsquo;s or masons&rsquo;s
work&mdash;all working well, and many of them cheerful in spite
of the presence of an official, and little apparently heeding the
sentry standing near with loaded gun ready to shoot, if need be,
a runaway.&nbsp; <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>We have heard gentlemen say that at
Bermuda and at Gibraltar, the convicts will not work.&nbsp; All
we can say is, that at Portland they do, and so effectually, as
to cost the country but little more than four or five pounds a
year.&nbsp; Our out door inspection over, we then went over the
sleeping apartments, and the chapel, and the kitchen, and
laundry, and bakery.&nbsp; The impression left on us was very
favourable.&nbsp; The food is of the plainest, but most
satisfactory character.&nbsp; The allowance for breakfast is 12
oz. of bread, 1 pint of tea or cocoa.&nbsp; Dinner, 1 pint of
soup, 5&frac12; oz. of meat, 1 lb. of potatoes, 6 oz., of bread
or pudding.&nbsp; Supper, 9 oz. of bread, 1 pint of gruel or
tea.&nbsp; The chapel is a handsome building, capable of
containing fifteen hundred people, and the sleeping apartments
were light and airy, and well ventilated.&nbsp; Each cell opens
into a corridor, there being a series of three or four storeys;
each sleeping apartment can contain from a hundred to five
hundred men; in each cell there is a hammock, and all that is
requisite for personal cleanliness, besides a book or two which
the convict is allowed to have from the library.&nbsp; Of course
the manner of life is somewhat monotonous.&nbsp; Before coming to
Portland, the prisoners have passed their allotted time,
(generally about nine months), in what is termed separate
confinement, at Pentonville, Millbank, Preston, Bedford,
Wakefield, or some other prison adapted for the first stage of
penal discipline.&nbsp; Upon their reception they are made to
undergo medical inspection, a change of clothes, and are required
to bathe; <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>they are then informed of the rules
and regulations of the prison, and moved to school for
examination in educational attainments, with a view to their
correct classification.&nbsp; Afterwards they receive an
appropriate address from the chaplain, and are allowed to write
their first letter from Portland to their relations.&nbsp; They
are then put to work, and are made to feel that their future
career depends in some measure on themselves.&nbsp; Thus there
are four classes, and the convict in the best class may earn as
much as two shillings-a-week, which is put to his credit, and
paid him when he becomes free, partly by a post-office order,
payable to him when he reaches his destination, and partly
afterwards.&nbsp; The dress consists of fustian, over which a
blue smock frock with white stripes is thrown.&nbsp; Convicts who
are dangerous, and have maltreated their keepers, instead of a
frock have a coat of a somewhat loud and striking
character.&nbsp; Then, again, a yellow dress denotes that the
convict has attempted to escape; and further, a blue cloth dress
denotes that the wearer, engaged as a pointsman, has but little
more time to stay, and has a little more freedom intrusted to
him.&nbsp; In the working days in summer the prison-bell rouses
all hands at a quarter-past five, allowing an hour for washing,
dressing, and breakfast.&nbsp; Then comes morning service in the
chapel.&nbsp; They are then marched off to labour, where they
remain till eleven, when they return to dinner.&nbsp; At
half-past twelve they are again paraded, and dismissed to labour
till six.&nbsp; Suppers are distributed to each cell at half-past
six, and at seven <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>evening service is held in the
chapel.&nbsp; The prisoners then return to their cells.&nbsp; In
winter-time they are recalled from labour at half-past four,
prayers are read at five, and supper is served at six; the
prisoners then return to their cells.&nbsp; At eight all lights
must be put out, and silence reigns in every hall, the slippered
night-guards alone gliding through the long and dimly-lighted
galleries like so many spectres.&nbsp; It may be that sorrow is
wakeful, but it is not so at Portland.&nbsp; If the men have
troubled consciences and uneasy hours, it is when they are at
work, and not during the period allotted to repose.&nbsp; They
are asleep as soon as ever the lights are put out, and till the
bell summons them to labour they sleep the sleep of the
just.&nbsp; Nor can we wonder at it.&nbsp; There is no sleep so
sweet and precious, as that earned by a long day&rsquo;s work in
the open air.</p>
<p>Attendance at chapel and walking exercise in the open air, are
the two great features of the Sunday&rsquo;s employment; and, as
a farther change, we may mention, each prisoner is allowed half a
day&rsquo;s schooling per week.&nbsp; While at work, of course
they talk together,&mdash;it is impossible to prevent
that,&mdash;and they choose their companions, and have their
friendships as if they were free; and even, as in the case of Sir
John Dean Paul, maintain&mdash;or endeavour to do so&mdash;the
social distinctions which were accorded to them when supposed to
be respectable members of respectable society.&nbsp; Altogether
here, as at many a worse place than Portland, the convicts must
work hard, for the contractor depends <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>on them for
the supply of stone which is sent down the tramway to the
Breakwater; but many of the men at Portland have been accustomed
to hard labour all their lives.&nbsp; They are chiefly young and
able-bodied, and here they are well cared for and taught.&nbsp;
Surely here, if anywhere, the convict may repent his crimes, and
be fitted to return to society a wiser and a better man!&nbsp; We
cannot exactly say what are the effects of all this; but surely
the convicts must be better from this separation from their usual
haunts and associates.&nbsp; Portland Prison is admirably adapted
for carrying out a great experiment in the treatment and
improvement of the criminal classes.&nbsp; It has now been in
existence twelve years, and the experiment hitherto has
succeeded.&nbsp; At any rate, if it is a blunder, it is not a
costly one, like some establishments nearer town.</p>
<p>It is now nearly ten years since transportation to the
colonies ceased to be a punishment for criminal offences.&nbsp;
The Tasmanian and Australian authorities refused to receive them;
and the government establishment at Norfolk Island was abandoned,
the home government resolving to make an effort to dispose of the
convict population in some other manner.&nbsp; The convict
establishment on the Island of Portland was the first scheme
proposed for the employment and reformation of offenders.&nbsp;
The principal object was to secure a place of confinement for
long-term convicts; the next, to systematically apply the labour
of such convicts to &ldquo;national works of importance,&rdquo;
the prosecution of which at once was profitable, <!-- page
183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>and afforded the means of training the convicts to
habits of industry.&nbsp; The Penal Servitude Act was passed in
1850, and under it the much-condemned ticket of leave came into
operation.&nbsp; It substituted sentences of penal servitude for
all crimes formerly visited by sentences of transportation to a
less period than 14 years.&nbsp; As few of such sentences,
comparatively, reached over that period, the Act practically
reduced the transportation sentences to a mere tithe of what they
were before&mdash;the average during the years from 1854 to 1857
not being more than 235 out of 3200.&nbsp; In 1857 the
transportation sentences only amounted to 110, while the penal
servitude sentences were 2474.&nbsp; In that year an Act was
passed with a small proportionate remission of sentence as a
reward for good conduct.&nbsp; The advantages of the system thus
established, were considered to be&mdash;1st, Its deterring
effects.&nbsp; 2nd, Its affording encouragement to the
convict.&nbsp; 3rd, As giving the means of dealing with
refractory convicts; and 4th, As affording means of employment to
offenders on their discharge.</p>
<p>Portland Prison, as the chief punitive establishment under
this new system, is, of course, most deserving notice.&nbsp; In
1857, the total expenditure on this prison was
&pound;48,782.&nbsp; The total value of the labour performed in
the same year was &pound;41,855, which, divided by 1488 (the
average number of prisoners), gave &pound;28. 2s. 7d. as the rate
per man.&nbsp; We doubt if the labour in our county prisons has
ever reached the half of this value.&nbsp; Large numbers of the
Portland prisoners have obtained employment <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>at harbour
and other similar works since their discharge, and generally
their conduct has been satisfactory.&nbsp; The Discharged
Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Society regularly assists the well-behaved
convicts in finding employment on their release from confinement,
and that society&rsquo;s operations have been remarkably
successful.&nbsp; Pentonville prison has ordinarily from five to
six hundred prisoners; while in Milbank the daily average number,
in 1857, was about 1100.&nbsp; Parkhurst prison is kept for boy
convicts, of whom the average daily number in 1857, was 431; and
Brixton, for females, of whom 784 in all were received in that
year.&nbsp; The Fulham Refuge is another female institution, in
which convicts are received previous to being discharged on
license, and in which they are taught a knowledge of household
work, such as cooking, washing, &amp;c., calculated to improve
their chances of getting employment.&nbsp; Portsmouth, Chatham,
Lewes, and Dartmoor are also used as convict establishments; the
latter, however, is being gradually given up, as utterly unfitted
for such a purpose, its temperature in winter somewhat
approaching to that of Nova Zembla.&nbsp; It is difficult to say
what are the numbers requiring to be disposed of in these convict
prisons in the average of years, but they probably range about
7,000 males and 1,200 females.&nbsp; If the decrease of crime in
1858 continue in subsequent years, our home prisons will amply
suffice for the reception of our convict population.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 185</span>CHARTER XVIII.<br />
CONCERNING CABS.</h2>
<p>One of the most blessed institutions of London is the
cab.&nbsp; I prefer it much to the &rsquo;bus&mdash;to equestrian
exercise&mdash;and if I had, which I have not, a carriage of my
own, I dare say I should prefer it even to that.&nbsp; If the
horse falls down, it is not yours that breaks its knees; if the
shafts suddenly snap asunder, they are not yours that are
damaged.&nbsp; And you need not be imposed on, unless you are
flat enough to ask cabby his fare, and then it serves you
right.&nbsp; The number of cabs now licensed in London is 4,500;
each common cab and the two horses with the appointments
requisite to work it are estimated to cost not more than
&pound;60, so that the capital engaged is, in round numbers,
upwards of &pound;270,000, provided by upwards of 1,800 small
owners.&nbsp; The waste of the capital committed by this
competition within the field of supply is visible to the eye, at
all times and all weathers, in full stands, or long files waiting
hour after hour, and in the numbers crawling about the streets
looking out for fares.&nbsp; The cost of the keep <!-- page
186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>of
each horse is estimated at 16s. 4d. per week&mdash;the
depreciation of horse stock is put down at 2s. 6d. per week each,
and of the vehicle at 8s. per week.&nbsp; The market value of the
labour of such a man as the driver of a cab may be set down in
London at 4s. per diem.&nbsp; The stable rent is at least 10s.
per week, per cab and horses, so that the capital invested for
man, horse, and vehicle, may be set down at more than one
shilling per hour lost during every hour of the twelve that cabs
are kept unemployed.&nbsp; On every cab-stand, where in foul
weather as well as fair a dozen cabs are seen constantly
unemployed, the administrative economist may see capital
evaporating in worse than waste at a rate of 12s. per hour,
&pound;7. 4s. per diem, or at a rate of between two and three
thousand pounds per annum, to be charged to some one, <i>i.e.</i>
the public.&nbsp; If all were employed, as the usual rate of
driving is six miles per hour, they must be each employed at
least four hours per diem to pay for their keep.&nbsp; If,
however, the cabs were constantly employed daily, at least three
horses must be employed, which would augment the charge, by that
of an additional horse, at the rate of 4d. per hour.&nbsp; A
large proportion of the cabs are employed during the whole 24
hours; but there are then two men, a night man and a day man, and
three horses.&nbsp; It is probably greatly below the fact to
state that at least one-third of the cabs are, the week through,
unemployed&mdash;that is to say, one-third of the capital
invested is wasted, a service for two capitals being competed for
by three, to the inevitable destruction of one.&nbsp; As in <!--
page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>other cases of competition within the field, efforts
are made by violent manifestations of discontent at the legal
fare, by mendacity, and by various modes of extortion, to charge
upon the public the expense of the wasted capital.&nbsp;
Sometimes it is in the form of a piteous appeal that the driver
or the competitor has been out all day and has not before had
&ldquo;one single blessed fare.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet the legal
charge for the frequently wretched service of the man, horse, and
vehicle is, when taken by the hour, nearly double, and by the
mile, nearly treble&mdash;when only two horses per diem are
used&mdash;its actual prime cost, which is, when driving at
little more than six miles an hour, 2d. or 3d. per mile, and when
waiting, 1s. 4d. per hour.&nbsp; But there is now a cry from the
cab proprietors that this charge of double the prime cost does
not pay, as it probably does not under such a ruinous system, and
an appeal is proposed to parliament for an augmentation of the
fares, but such augmentations, under this principle of
competition within the field, would only aggravate the evil, for
it would lead to an increased number of competitors, and instead
of there being a competition of three to do the work of two,
there would be a competition of two or more to do the work of
one&mdash;that is, a greater waste of capital to be paid for by
some one.&nbsp; Since the reduction of the fares in 1852, the
number of cabs in the metropolis, instead of being reduced, has
been increased from 3297 to 4507 in 1857.</p>
<p>The criminal returns afford melancholy indications of their
moral condition to those conversant with penal <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>statistics.&nbsp; Thus, in the police returns we find,
under the head of &ldquo;Coach and cabmen&rdquo;&mdash;but it is
stated by the police to be chiefly of cabmen&mdash;a very heavy
list of offences.&nbsp; In the year 1854 it was 682; in the year
before that, 777.&nbsp; The recurring crimes are thus
denoted:</p>

<p>In respect to this service of cabs, says a writer&mdash;from
whom I have taken these figures, I regret I cannot find out his
name, that I might quote it&mdash;&ldquo;the analysed charges and
statistics show that by a properly-conducted competition by
adequate capital for the whole field&mdash;for which, in my view,
the chief police or local administrative authorities ought, as
servants of the public, to be made responsible&mdash;service
equal to the present might be obtained at 3d. or 4d. per mile; or
at the present legal fare of 6d. per mile, a service approaching
in condition to that of private carriages, might be insured out
of the waste which now occurs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>A pleasant way of getting along is that of getting in a
Hansom, and bidding the driver drive on.&nbsp; A great
improvement, undoubtedly, on the old Hackney coach, or on that
first species of cab&mdash;consisting of a gig with a very
dangerous hood&mdash;on one side of which sat the driver, while
on the other was suspended yourself.&nbsp; Now as you dash
merrily along, with a civil driver, a luxurious equipage, and not
a bad sort of horse, little do you think that you may be driving
far further than you intended, to a dangerous illness and an
early grave.</p>
<p>A terrible danger threatens all who live in London, or who
visit it, by means of a custom&mdash;which ought not to be
tolerated for an instant&mdash;of carrying sick persons in cabs
to hospitals.&nbsp; No doubt the increase of smallpox in the
metropolis may be referred to this source.&nbsp; Put a case of
smallpox into a comfortable cab for an hour, then send the
vehicle into the streets; first a merchant sits in it for a
quarter of an hour, then a traveller from the railway gets his
chance of catching the disease, and so on for the next week or
two.&nbsp; When it takes, the victims have had no warning of
their impending danger, and wonder where they got it.&nbsp; They
in their turn become new centres of disease, and for the next few
weeks they infect the air they breathe, the houses they inhabit,
the clothing sent to the laundress, and everybody and everything
which comes within their influence, and it is impossible to say
where the infection ceases.&nbsp; The following arrangements
would easily, cheaply, and effectually do away with the
evil:&mdash;1. Make it penal to let or to <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>hire a
public vehicle for the conveyance of any person affected with
contagious disease.&nbsp; 2. Every institution for the reception
of contagious disease should undertake to fetch the patient on
receipt of a medical certificate as to the nature of the
case.</p>
<p>Do not be too confidential with cabby, nor ask him what he
charges, nor hold out a handful of silver to him and ask him to
pay himself, nor give him a sovereign in mistake for a shilling,
and delude yourself with the idea that he will return it.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t tell him you are in a hurry to catch the train.&nbsp;
I once offered the driver of a Hansom a shilling for a ride from
the Post Office to the Angel, Islington; he was so disgusted that
he plainly informed me that if he&rsquo;d a known I was only
going to give him a shilling, he&rsquo;d be blessed if he would
not have lost the mail for me.&nbsp; The repeal of the newspaper
stamp has done wonders for cabby.&nbsp; He now takes in his
morning paper the same as any other gentleman.&nbsp; To ride in a
cab is the extent of some people&rsquo;s idea of happiness.&nbsp;
I heard of a clerk who had absconded with some money belonging to
an employer, he had spent it all in chartering a cab, and in
riding about in it all day.&nbsp; M.P.&rsquo;s are much in the
habit of using cabs.&nbsp; On one occasion an M.P. who had been
at a party, hurrying down to a division, was changing his evening
costume for one more appropriate to business.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, in the most interesting part of the transaction,
the cab was upset and the M.P. was exhibited in a state which
would have made Lord Elcho very angry.</p>
<p><!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>Cab drivers I look upon as misanthropic
individuals.&nbsp; I fancy many of them were railway directors in
the memorable year of speculation, and have known better
days.&nbsp; The driver of a buss is a prince of good fellows
compared with a cabman.&nbsp; The former has no pecuniary
anxieties to weigh him down, he is full of fun in a quiet way,
and in case of a quarrel he has his conductor to take his
side&mdash;he has his regular employment and his regular pay; the
cabby is alone, and has to do battle with all the world, and he
has often horses to drive and people to deal with that would tire
the patience of a Job.&nbsp; He is constantly being
aggravated&mdash;there is no doubt about that; the magistrates
aggravate him&mdash;the police aggravate him&mdash;his fares
aggravate him&mdash;his &rsquo;oss aggravates him&mdash;the
crowded state of the street, and the impossibility of getting
along aggravates him&mdash;the weather aggravates him&mdash;if it
is hot he feels it, and has a terrible tendency to get
dry&mdash;and if it is cold and wet not even his damp wrappers
and overcoats can keep out, I suspect, chilblains; and I know he
has corns, and he will use bad language in a truly distressing
manner.&nbsp; Then his hours of work are such as to ruffle a
naturally serene temper, and when he finds it hard work to make
both ends meet, and sees how gaily young fellows spend their
money&mdash;how he drives them from one public to another, and
from one place of amusement to another&mdash;and in what
questionable society,&mdash;one can scarce wonder if now and then
cabby is a little sour, and if his language be as rough as his
thoughts.&nbsp; Strange tales can he tell.&nbsp; <!-- page
192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>A
friend of the writer&rsquo;s once hired a chaise to take him
across the country; their way led them through a turnpike-gate,
and, to my friend&rsquo;s horror, the driver never once pulled up
to allow him to pay the toll.&nbsp; My friend expostulated; as
the toll had to be paid, he thought the better plan was to pay it
at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Jehu,
smiling, &ldquo;they know me well enough&mdash;I am the man wot
drives the prisoners, and prisoners never pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
London cabby is often similarly employed, and, as he rushes by,
we may well speculate as to the nature and mission of his
fare.&nbsp; Cabby so often drives rogues that we cannot wonder if
in time he becomes a bit of a rogue himself.</p>

FREE DRINKING FOUNTAINS.</h2>
<p>Till lately the London poor had no means of getting water but
the pump or the public-house.&nbsp; Of the latter we can have but
a poor opinion, nor all the former much better.&nbsp; It appears
that &ldquo;the London pumps can never be otherwise than
dangerous sources of supply; the porous sod from which they suck
being that into which our cesspools and leaky drains discharge a
great part of their fluid&mdash;sometimes even a great part of
their solid contents, and in which, till very recently, all our
interments have taken place.&nbsp; It is a soil which
consequently abounds with putrid and putrefiable matter.&nbsp;
The water derived from it invariably contains products of organic
decomposition, more or less oxidised; and it is a mere chance,
beyond the power of water-drinkers to measure or control, whether
that oxidation shall at all times be so incomplete as to have
left the water still capable of a very dangerous kind of
fermentation.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are further told that, &ldquo;the
shallow well water receives the drainage of Highgate Cemetery, of
numerous burial grounds, and of innumerable <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>cesspools
which percolate the soil on the London side of the Cemetery, and
flow towards the Metropolis. . . .&nbsp; That the pump-water also
becomes contaminated with the residual liquors of manufacturing
processes. . . .&nbsp; That a man who habitually makes use of
London pump-water, lives in perpetual danger of
disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one of the greatest and most unexpected sources of danger
is, that the sense of taste or smell fails to warn us of the
danger of using such water, since clearness, coolness, and
tastelessness, may exist, without being evidences of
wholesomeness.&nbsp; We are also told that &ldquo;the carbonic
acid of the decomposed matter makes them sparkling, and the
nitrates they contain give them a pleasant coolness to the taste,
so that nothing could be better adapted to lure their victims to
destruction than the external qualities of these
waters&mdash;hence the worst of them are most popular for
drinking purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nitrates with which these waters are charged generally
proceed from the decomposition of animal matter, such as the
corpses interred in London churchyards; hence the popularity of
some pumps near churchyards; and to such an extent are some of
these waters charged with this ingredient, that J. B. C. Aldis,
M.D., declares the water of a surface-well (though cool and
sparkling to the taste) twice exploded during the process of
incineration when he was analysing it!</p>
<p>Under these peculiar circumstances it does seem strange that
in London the weary, the thirsty, and the poor have thus
practically been driven to the public <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>house, and
that they should have been left without an alternative.&nbsp; A
man toiling all day, bearing, it may be, heavy burdens in the
summer sun, miles it may be from his home, parched with thirst,
practically to quench that thirst has been compelled to resort to
the beer-shop or the gin-palace.&nbsp; And what has been the
consequence, that the man has been led to drink more than was
good for him&mdash;that he has got into bad company&mdash;that he
has wasted his time and his money, injured his health, and
possibly been led into the commission of vice and crime.&nbsp;
Every day the evil has been demonstrated in the most striking, in
the most alarming, and in the most abundant manner.&nbsp; A
benevolent gentleman at Liverpool was the first to see the evil,
and to devise a remedy.&nbsp; He erected fountains, elegant and
attractive in character, furnished with pure water, and in one
day of about thirteen hours twenty-four thousand seven hundred
and two persons drank at the thirteen fountains in that
town.&nbsp; Of that twenty-four thousand seven hundred and two
persons, many would otherwise have resorted to public-houses or
gin-palaces to quench their thirst.&nbsp; In smaller places,
where results are easier to ascertain, it has been found that in
reality the fountains do keep people from frequenting beer-shops,
and, therefore, do keep them sober.&nbsp; A gentleman who largely
employs workmen in ironworks in the town of Wednesbury, having
recently erected fountains for his workpeople, says that his
manager has since observed an improvement in their habits and
regularity <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>of attendance, attributable to their
discarded use of beer, in consequence of the facility of
obtaining pure water which the fountains afford.&nbsp; The
publicans in London understand this, as it appears from the
report of the committee of the Free Drinking Association, held at
Willis&rsquo;s Rooms last week, when the drinking cups have been
missing they have invariably been found at some neighbouring
public-house.&nbsp; The movement, as we have intimated, commenced
at Liverpool; it was not long before it reached London.&nbsp;
According to Mr. Wakefield, the honorary secretary of the
Association, there was a greater need for this movement in London
than elsewhere, owing to the fact that the greater radiation of
heat from a larger surface of buildings, less shade, more smoke
and dust, and longer street distances, combines to make London a
more thirst-exciting place than any provincial town.&nbsp; Mr.
Samuel Gurney, M.P., was the first, who, in a letter published in
some of the Loudon papers, called attention to the grievous
privation which the want of these fountains inflicted on the
London poor, and subsequently by his great personal influence and
liberal pecuniary contributions, and unwearied exertions founded
the Association; the Earl of Shaftesbury, the Earl of Carlisle,
the Archbishop of Canterbury, and other distinguished noblemen
and gentlemen rallied around him.&nbsp; London parishes and
vestries have most of them come forward and contributed, and
already nearly a hundred drinking fountains have been erected by
this Association.&nbsp; It is inferred from the Liverpool <!--
page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>statistics that at least 400 fountains might be
advantageously erected in London; these could not be constructed
and kept in repair at a less cost than &pound;20,000.&nbsp; To
gain this sum the Association appeals to the public.&nbsp; Last
year the total receipts of the Association amounted to
&pound;2,609; much more is required; a very good sign, indicative
of the appreciation on the part of Londoners of the boon offered
them, is found in the fact that the poor themselves are
contributing voluntarily and in an unostentatious manner to
defray the expenses of erection.&nbsp; The plan of attaching
moneyboxes to the fountains for the donations of friends has been
adopted, and the first money-box has been placed at the first
erected fountain on Snow Hill.&nbsp; So far as the experience of
four weeks justifies an opinion, it is very encouraging, and a
sum of 8d. a day has been deposited in small coins, varying from
farthings to two-shilling pieces.&nbsp; The experiment is to be
extended to five other fountains, when, if successful, it is
proposed to supply every fountain with a money-box, when the
erection will be more than self-supporting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of all
the efforts I have been called to make,&rdquo; said the Earl of
Shaftesbury, &ldquo;there is none that so strongly commends
itself to my feelings and my judgment as the Free Drinking
Fountain movement.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Earl of Carlisle says,
&ldquo;Erect drinking fountains, and habits of intemperance will
soon show a diminution, and with a diminution of intemperance
will be stopped the most prolific of all the sources of crime and
misery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most people will <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>say the
same, and we look upon these fountains&mdash;elegant in
character, supplied with pure water&mdash;as a grateful
acknowledgment by the richer classes of the interest and sympathy
they feel for those in less happy circumstances.</p>
<p>As evidence of the grateful interest elicited by this movement
in the humblest classes, let the reader take the following
letters.&nbsp; The first was addressed, &ldquo;for Mr. Samuel
Gurney Esquire who bilt the fountaine Newgate Street.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>to Mr. Gurney esquire</p>

and good Management the Working Women could also form and do <!--

the working Classes as their Subscriptions could be distinct from
ours; as of course our means are very limited; but surely we
could most of us become Subscribers at twopence per week in so
noble a cause that bids fair to drive the curse of Public Houses
from our land&mdash;King&rsquo;s Cross wants one much, and there
is room in the open Square also at the Portland Road at the end
of Euston Road.&nbsp; They ought to be round or Square with 4 or
6 places to Drink from, with something of interest to mark to
whose honour they were raised.&nbsp; One Subject could be Prince
Edward suppressing the wine houses in Gibraltar, 1792.&nbsp; I
think nothing could be better for the purpose as we all feel
something must be done to stop this crying evil that is sending
thousands to Death and Madness&mdash;the other subject could be
Alderman Wood who rose from a poor Charity School Boy of Tiverton
Devonshire to plead the Duke of Kent&rsquo;s return to England
that his child, our present good queen, should be born on British
ground; so we as a people have to thank the late Sir Matthew Wood
for that.&nbsp; I think the wives and daughters of freemasons
will give freely in respect to the late Duke of Kent who spent I
may say thousands to raise the standard of that noble order. . .

</blockquote>
<p>As evidence of the filthy nature of London water and of the
need of fountains, let the reader take the following letter from
Dr. Letheby, the City Medical Officer, addressed to the Honorary
Secretary of the Drinking Fountain Association; and let the
reader bear in mind that Dr. Letheby&rsquo;s evidence is
confirmed by that of upwards of fifty other medical
gentlemen.&nbsp; Dr. Letheby says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From what I know of the habits of the poor
within this city, I am led to believe that the erection of
drinking fountains would be of especial service to them; for
although the average supply of water to the metropolis is
abundant, yet the distribution of it is so unequal that the
poorer classes do not obtain their proper proportion; in fact,
this has become so serious a matter in most of the courts and
alleys of this city, that I have great difficulty in dealing with
it.&nbsp; You are, no doubt, aware that the water companies have
been obliged to shorten the time of supply ever since they have
been compelled by the Act of Parliament to furnish filtered water
to the public; and, as the poor have not the means of altering
the present condition of the service, and adapting it to the new
arrangement, their receptacles are never filled during the short
time that the water is on.&nbsp; Every contrivance is, therefore,
<!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>used to secure as much water as possible while it is
flowing; but, partly from the filthy state of the cisterns, and
partly from the f&oelig;tid emanations to which the water is
exposed in the over-crowded rooms in which it is kept, it is
rarely, if ever, drinkable.&nbsp; The poor, then, would be too
glad to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the
public fountains, and would, I am quite sure, hail them as boons
of the greatest value; and when it comes to be known that the
water which flows from the fountains is as pure as chemical and
other contrivances can render it, the boon will most assuredly be
prized by all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present, the public wells of this city are largely
used by all classes of persons; and, knowing what I do of the
composition of these waters, I have looked with much concern at
the probable mischief that might be occasioned by them; for
though they are generally grateful to the palate, and deliriously
cool, they are rich in all kinds of filthy decomposing products,
as the soakage from sewers and cesspools, and the not less
repulsive matters from the over-crowded churchyards.&nbsp; What,
therefore, can be of greater importance to the public than the
opportunity of drinking water which shall not only be grateful
and cool, as that from the city pumps, but which shall have none
of its lurking dangers?</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the quality of the water that is now supplied by
the public companies I can speak in the fullest confidence, for
it is not merely the most available for <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>your
purposes, but it is in reality the best supply that can be
obtained.&nbsp; I need not describe the admirable arrangements
that have been employed by the several companies for the
purification of the water, but I may state that there is not a
city in Europe that has so large a supply of good water as this
metropolis, and I do not know where or how you could obtain a
better.&nbsp; I say, therefore, without hesitation, that the
water supplied by the public companies is the best that can be
used for the fountains; and, seeing that it will be twice
filtered, and carefully freed from every kind of impurity by the
most perfect chemical and mechanical contrivances, there need be
no hesitation on the part of the most fastidious in freely
drinking at the public fountains.&rdquo;</p>

CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p>One bright May morning in the year of our Lord, 1445, the
streets of London presented an unusually animated
appearance.&nbsp; Here and there were quaint devices and rare
allegories, well pleasing alike to the rude eye and taste of
citizen and peer.&nbsp; From dark lane and darker alley poured
forth swarms eager to behold the stranger, who, young,
high-spirited, and beautiful, had come to wear the diadem of
royalty, and to share the English throne.&nbsp; The land of love
and song had given her birth.&nbsp; Her &ldquo;gorgeous
beauty,&rdquo; as our national dramatist describes it, had been
ripened but by fifteen summers&rsquo;s suns.&nbsp; Hope told a
flattering tale.&nbsp; She discerned not the signs that
prophesied a dark and dreary future.&nbsp; A tempest rudely
greeted her as she landed on our shores.&nbsp; Sickness preyed
upon her frame.&nbsp; Those whose fathers&rsquo;s bones were
bleaching on the battle-fields of France murmured that Maine and
Anjou, won by so free an expenditure of English blood and gold,
should be ceded to the sire of one who, dowerless, came to claim
the throne, and, as <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>it speedily appeared, to rule the
fortunes, of <span class="smcap">Henry Plantagenet</span>.&nbsp;
In mercy the sad perspective of thirty wintry years was hidden
from her view.&nbsp; She dreamt not of the cup of bitterness it
was hers to drink&mdash;how she should be driven from the land
that then hailed her with delight&mdash;how all that woman should
abhor should be laid to her charge&mdash;how, in her desolate
chateau, stripped of her power, and fame, and crown, lonely and
broken-hearted, she should spend the evening of her life in
unavailing sorrow and regret, till, with bloodshot eyes, and
wrinkled brow, and leprous skin, she should become all that men
shuddered to behold.&nbsp; But onward passed the procession, and
smiles were on her lips, and joy was in her heart.&nbsp; Bright
was her queenly eye, and beautiful was her flaxen hair, so well
known in romance or in the songs of wandering troubadour.&nbsp;
Around her were the children of no common race, gallant and
haughty, dark-eyed Norman barons, ready to keep, as their fathers
had won, with their own good swords, power and nobility upon
British soil.</p>
<p>Years have come and gone.&nbsp; The great ones of the earth
have felt their power slip from them.&nbsp; Crowns and sceptres
have turned to dust.&nbsp; Thrones have tottered to their fall;
but there was then that evolving itself of which succeeding ages
have witnessed but the more full development.&nbsp; In that
procession there were symptoms of a coming change&mdash;signs,
and warning voices, that told the noble that the power and pride
of the individual man was being torn from him&mdash;that he had
been weighed <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>in the balance and found
wanting.&nbsp; The trading companies&mdash;the sons of the Saxon
churl&mdash;<span class="smcap">the middle
classes</span>&mdash;for the first time appeared upon the scene,
and were deemed a fitting escort to royalty.&nbsp; History
herself has deigned to tell us of their show and
bravery&mdash;how, on horseback, with blue gowns and embroidered
shoes, and red hoods, they joined the nobles and prelates of our
land.&nbsp; Four hundred years have but seen the increase of
their wealth, of their respectability, and power.&nbsp; Their
struggle upwards has been long and tedious, but it has been safe
and sure.&nbsp; The wars of the red rose and the white&mdash;wars
which beggared the princes of England, and spilt the blood of its
nobles like water&mdash;were favourable to the progress of the
middle class.&nbsp; The battle of Barnet witnessed the fall and
death of the kingmaker, and with her champion feudalism
fell.&nbsp; The power passed from the baron.&nbsp; The most
thoughtless began to perceive that a time was coming when mere
brute strength would fail its possessor.&nbsp; Dim and shadowy
notions of the superiority of right to might were loosened from
the bondage of the past, and set afloat; discoveries, strange and
wonderful, became the property of the many; the fountains of
knowledge, and thought, and fame were opened, and men pressed
thither, eager to win higher honour than that obtained by the
intrigues of court, or the accidents of birth.</p>
<p>With all that was bright and good did the middle classes
identify themselves.&nbsp; In them was the stronghold of
civilization.&nbsp; The prince and peer were unwilling to <!--
page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>admit of changes in polity, in religion, or in law,
which to them could bring no good, and might possibly bring
harm.&nbsp; Conventional usage had stamped them with a higher
worth than that which by right belonged to them; their
adulterated gold passed as current coin; hence it was their
interest to oppose every attempt to establish a more natural
test.&nbsp; The aristocracy ceased to be the thinkers of the
age.&nbsp; From the middle classes came the men whose words and
deeds we will not willingly let die.&nbsp; Shakspere, Milton, and
Cromwell shew what of genius, and power, and divine aim, at one
time the middle classes contained.</p>
<p>And now, once more, is there not an upheaving of humanity from
beneath? and over society as it is, does not once more loom the
shadow of a coming change?&nbsp; Does not middle-class
civilization in its mode of utterance and thought, betoken
symptoms of decay?&nbsp; Look at it as it does the genteel thing,
and sleeps an easy hour in Episcopalian church or Dissenting
chapel&mdash;as it faintly applauds a world-renovating principle,
and gracefully bows assent to a divine idea.&nbsp; Ask it its
problem of life, its mission, and it knows no other than to have
a good account at the bank, and to keep a gig; possibly, if it be
very ambitious, it may, in its heart of hearts, yearn for a
couple of flunkeys and a fashionable square.&nbsp; It is very
moral and very religious.&nbsp; Much is it attached to morality
and religion in the abstract; but to take one step in their
behalf&mdash;to cut the shop, for their sake, for an
hour&mdash;is a thing it rarely does.&nbsp; Often is it too much
<!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>trouble for it to vote at a municipal election&mdash;to
employ the franchise to which it has a right&mdash;to support the
man or the paper that advocates its principles.&nbsp; That is, it
refuses to grapple with the great principle of ill with which man
comes into this world to make war; and, rather than lose a pound,
or sacrifice its respectability, or depart from the routine of
formalism into which it has grown, it will let the devil take
possession of the world.</p>
<p>Looked at from a right point of view, the world&rsquo;s
history is a series of dissolving views.&nbsp; We have had the
gorgeous age of nobility, the money-making one of the
middle-classes&mdash;lower still we must go.&nbsp; Truth lies at
the bottom of the well; the pearls, whose lustre outshine even
beauty&rsquo;s eye are hidden in the deep.&nbsp; The men who now
stamp their impress on the age&mdash;whose thought is genuine and
free&mdash;who shew the hollowness of shams&mdash;who demand for
the common brotherhood of man their common rights&mdash;who
herald a coming age&mdash;who are its teachers and
apostles&mdash;originally laboured in coal-mines, like
Stephenson; or mended shoes, like Cooper; or plied the shuttle,
like Fox; or stood, as did Burns and Nicoll, at the plough, with
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> heaven above them, and
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> inspiration in their
hearts.</p>
<p>The decline and fall of England has already found chroniclers
enough.&nbsp; Ledru Rollin and the Protectionists are agreed as
regards the lamentable fact.&nbsp; G. F. Young, the chairman of
the Society for the Protection of British Industry and Capital,
believed it as firmly as his own <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>existence.&nbsp; A similar opinion is more than hinted
in the tedious History of Dr. Alison.&nbsp; At a still earlier
period the same doleful tale was ever on the lips and pervaded
the writings of Southey, the Laureate and the renegade.&nbsp; If
these gentlemen are right, then the melancholy conviction must be
forced upon us that England has seen her best days; that it will
never be with her what it was in time past, when she bred up an
indomitable race, when her flag of triumph fluttered in every
breeze, and floated on every sea.&nbsp; We must believe that
England&rsquo;s sun is about to set; that, with its brightness
and its beauty, it will never more bless and irradiate the
world.</p>
<p>Against such a conclusion we emphatically protest.&nbsp; We
look back upon our national career, and we see that each age has
witnessed the people&rsquo;s growth in political power; that
especially since that grand field-day of Democracy, the French
Revolution, that power has gone on increasing with accelerated
force; that it was to the increased ascendancy of that power that
we owed it that we rode in safety whilst the political ocean was
covered with wreck and ruin.&nbsp; If one thing be clearer than
another in our national history, it is that our greatness and the
power of the people have grown together.&nbsp; At a season like
the present it is well to remember this.&nbsp; Prophets often
fulfil their own prophecies.&nbsp; The Jeremiads of the weak, or
the interested, or the fearful, may damp the courage of some
hearts; and a people told that they are ruined, that the poor are
becoming poorer every day, that the <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>end of all
labour is the workhouse or the gaol, that their life is but a
lingering death, may come to believe that the handwriting is upon
the wall, and that it is hopeless to war with fate.</p>
<p>The fact is, nations, when they die, die of
<i>felo-de-se</i>.&nbsp; The national heart becomes unsound, and
the national arm weak.&nbsp; The virtue has gone out of it.&nbsp;
Its rulers have usurped despotic powers, and the people have been
sunk in utter imbecility, or have looked upon life as a May-day
game, and nothing more.&nbsp; In our cold northern
clime&mdash;with the remains of that equality born and bred
amidst the beech-forests that bordered the Baltic&mdash;the
English people could never stoop to this; and hence our glorious
destiny.&nbsp; No nation under heaven&rsquo;s broad light has
been more sorely tried than our own.&nbsp; We have taken into pay
almost every European power.&nbsp; Our war to restore the <span
class="smcap">Bourbons</span>, and thus to crush Liberalism at
home, and keep the Tories in office, was carried on at a cost
which only Englishmen could have paid; and yet from our long
seasons of distress&mdash;from our commercial panics, the result
of fettered trade&mdash;from our formidable continental
wars&mdash;we have emerged with flying colours, and indomitable
strength.&nbsp; Mr. Porter&rsquo;s statistics showed what we had
done in the face of difficulty and danger, and the progress we
have made since Mr. Porter&rsquo;s time is something
prodigious.&nbsp; Not yet has the arm of the people been weakened
or its eye dulled.</p>
<p>These are facts such as the united Croaker tribe can <!-- page
210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>neither refute nor deny.&nbsp; We understand the
meaning of such men when they raise a cry of alarm.&nbsp; What
such men dread does in reality infuse into the constitution fresh
vigour and life.&nbsp; Not national death, but the reverse is the
result.&nbsp; The removal of one abuse, behind which monopoly and
class legislation have skulked, is like stripping from the
monarch of the forest the foul parasite by which his beauty is
hidden and his strength devoured.&nbsp; From such operations the
constitution comes out with the elements of life more copious and
active in it than before.&nbsp; It finds a wider base in the
support and attachment of the people; it becomes more sympathetic
with them.&nbsp; It grows with their growth and strengthens with
their strength.</p>
<p>It is not true, then, that for us the future is more fraught
with anxiety than hope.&nbsp; The theory is denied by fact.&nbsp;
It is not true commercially, nor is it true morally.&nbsp; Our
progress in morals and manners is, at least, equal to our
progress in trade.&nbsp; The coarse manners&mdash;the brutal
intoxication&mdash;the want of all faith in spiritual realities,
held not merely by the laity but by the clergy as well of the
last century, now no longer exists.&nbsp; Reverend Deans do not
now write to ladies as did the bitter Dean of St. Patrick&rsquo;s
to his Stella.&nbsp; Sure are we that Victoria cannot speak of
her bishops as, according to Lord Hervey, George II. did, and
justly, speak of his.&nbsp; No Prime Minister now would dare to
insult the good feeling of the nation by handing his paramour to

name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>graphically
display a state of things which happily now no longer
exists.&nbsp; The gossip of our times reveals
enough&mdash;alas!&mdash;too much&mdash;of human weakness and
immorality; but the gossip of our times is as far superior to
that which Horace Walpole has so faithfully preserved, or to that
which Mrs. Manley in her &ldquo;New Atlantis&rdquo; sullied her
woman&rsquo;s name by retailing, or to that which Count Grammont
thought it no disgrace to record, as light to darkness or as
dross to gold.&nbsp; Macaulay thus describes the country squire
of the seventeenth century:&mdash;&ldquo;His chief pleasures were
commonly derived from field-sports, and from an unrefined
sensuality.&nbsp; His language and his pronunciation were such as
we should now only expect to hear from ignorant clowns.&nbsp; His
oaths, coarse jokes, and scurrilous terms of abuse were uttered
with the broadest accents of his province.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
country squire of the nineteenth century is surely some
improvement upon this; nor has the improvement been confined to
him&mdash;it has extended to all classes.&nbsp; We still hear
much, for instance, of drunkenness, but drunkenness does not
prevail as it did when publicans wrote on their signs, as
Smollett tells us they did,&mdash;&ldquo;You may here get drunk
for one penny, dead drunk for two pence, and clean straw for
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, then, we lay down our pen in hope.&nbsp; We have
undergone struggles deep and severe, and such struggles we may
still continue to have.&nbsp; With a debt of eight hundred
millions like a millstone round our neck&mdash;with a population
increasing at the rate of a thousand a <!-- page 212--><a

212</span>day&mdash;with Ireland&rsquo;s ills not yet
remedied&mdash;with half the landed property of the country in
the hands of the lawyer or the Jew&mdash;with discordant colonies
in all parts of the globe&mdash;with large masses in our midst
degraded by woe and want&mdash;barbarians in the midst of
civilization&mdash;heathens in the full blaze of Christian
light&mdash;no man can deny that there are breakers ahead.&nbsp;
Rather from what we see around us we may conclude that we shall
have storms to weather, severe as any that have awakened the
energy and heroism of our countrymen in days gone by.&nbsp; But
the history of the past teaches us how those storms will be met
and overcome.&nbsp; Not by accident is modern history so rich in
the possession of the new creed and the new blood, for the want
of which the glory of Athens and Corinth, and of her &ldquo;who
was named eternal&rdquo; passed away as a dream of the
night.&nbsp; Not that England may perish does that new blood
course through the veins, and that new creed fructify in the
hearts of her sons.&nbsp; The progress we have made is the surest
indication of the progress it is yet our destiny to make.&nbsp;
Onward, then, ye labourers for humanity, heralds of a coming
age&mdash;onward then till</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We
sweep into a younger day.<br />
Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who would deny the people their political
rights&mdash;who would teach a Christianity unworthy of its
name&mdash;who would inculcate a conventional morality&mdash;who
would degrade the national heart by perpetuating <!-- page
213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>religious and political shams&mdash;they, and not the
foreigner, are our national enemies.&nbsp; Against them must we
wage untiring war, for they are hostile to the progress of the
nation, and by that hostility sin against the progress of the
world.&nbsp; England will still stand foremost in the files of
time&mdash;and of that England, London will still remain the
heart and head.</p>

press</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would wish for this little volume an attentive
perusal on the part of all to whom inclination or duty, or both,
give an interest in the moral, the social, and the religious
condition of their fellow-men; above all, we should wish to see
it in the hands of bishops, and other ecclesiastical
dignitaries&mdash;of metropolitan rectors and fashionable
preachers&mdash;of statesmen and legislators&mdash;and of that
most mischievous class of men, well-meaning
philanthropists.&nbsp; The picture of life in London, of its
manifold pitfalls of temptation and corruption, which are here
presented to the reader&rsquo;s eye, is truly appalling.&nbsp; No
one can rise from it without a deep conviction that something
must be done, ay, and that soon, if the metropolis of the British
Empire is not to become a modern Sodom and
Gomorrah.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John Bull</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a matter-of-fact reality about the sketches,
but they are chiefly remarkable for the moral tone of their
reflections.&nbsp; Generally speaking, painters of these subjects
rather throw a purple light over the actual scenes, and say
nothing of the consequences to which they lead.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie
is ever stripping off the mask of the mock gaiety before him, and
pointing the end to which it must finally
come.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have kept Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s book lying on our
table, hoping that we might find an opportunity for making it the
basis of an article on the fearful evils which it
discloses.&nbsp; We must be satisfied, however, for the present,
with recommending all our readers who are anxious to promote the
social and moral regeneration of our great cities to read it
carefully; and to remember, while they read, that London does not
stand alone, but that all our larger towns are cursed with
abominations, such as those which Mr. Ritchie has so vigourously
and effectually described.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Eclectic
Review</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The author of &lsquo;The Night-Side of London&rsquo;
has graphically described the scenes of debauchery which are to
be found at night.&nbsp; It is a fearful and shocking

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;The subject is an interesting one, and it is treated
with very considerable ability.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie has the
valuable art of saying many things in few words: he is never
diffuse, never dull, and succeeds in being graphic without
becoming flippant.&nbsp; Occasionally his strength of thought and
style borders rather too closely on coarseness; but this fault of
vigorous natures is counterbalanced by compensatory
merit&mdash;by an utter absence of cant, a manly grasp of
thought, and a wise and genial human-heartedness.&nbsp; The book
is a sincere book; the writer says what he means, and means what
he says.&nbsp; In these half-earnest days it is a comfort to meet
with any one who has &lsquo;the courage of his opinions&rsquo;
especially on such a subject as the &lsquo;London
Pulpit.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily News</i>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie ought to be a popular author, and largely
read by a numerous and highly respectable
class.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all written with such a knowledge of each
subject as might be expected from a perceptive and accurate
observer, who has gained his experience from himself, while the
descriptive writing is that of a practised
hand.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Illustrated London News</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can give to this work our heartiest praise.&nbsp;
&lsquo;About London&rsquo; is written by one whose object is as
much to instruct as to amuse, and who succeeds without any
apparent effort in doing both.&nbsp; We say without any apparent
effort, because Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s sketches are too bold to be
stiff, his style too fluent and natural to be laboured.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding this, &lsquo;About London&rsquo; displays an
amount of industrious research very rarely met with, and a
knowledge of men and manners which only experience&mdash;and
active experience, moreover&mdash;can
supply.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The subjects for the most part are familiar to us, and
the easy and unaffected style in which they are treated is always
sure to gratify without wearying the
reader.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Advertiser</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie has already given us various works devoted
to metropolitan subjects, such as &lsquo;The Night Side of
Loudon,&rsquo; &lsquo;The London Pulpit,&rsquo; &lsquo;Here and
There in London.&rsquo;&nbsp; His volume &lsquo;About
London&rsquo; will, no doubt, be as widely circulated as its
predecessors.&nbsp; In it he communicates a vast mass of
information in a pleasant, gossiping style.&mdash;<i>Illustrated
News of the World</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie is well and favourably known as one of
those writers who, whilst possessed of a keen and observant eye,
remarks all the social inconsistencies of which human society in
the great modern Babylon is composed, and spares neither those
who may be said to hold the language of the first
murderer&mdash;&lsquo;Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rsquo; nor
others, who grovel in the sensuality, which speedily deforms man
into little less than the beast of the earth.&nbsp; In this, the
last of the several books in which he has related the doings of
London life, high and low, he does not enter so fully into the
mysteries of the singular career of the Arabs of our streets, but
touches matters <!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>on a somewhat higher level with the
same force and intelligence, which he has hitherto manifested,
combined with a more genial and pleasant refinement, which will
commend its information to those who may have been disposed to be
somewhat hypercritical as to the advisability of too closely
&lsquo;holding the mirror up to nature,&rsquo; and showing vice
its own deformity and horror.&mdash;<i>Bella Weekly
Messenger</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new book by Mr. Ritchie, entitled &lsquo;About
London,&rsquo; fully sustains the reputation of the author of
&lsquo;The Night Side of London.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is, both in
matter and manner, a most readable volume.&nbsp; In a series of
twenty chapters the more conspicuous and characteristic places
and persons about London are admirably sketched.&nbsp; The author
indulges in all his modes.&nbsp; He is observant, penetrative,
didactic, satirical, and reflective.&nbsp; Health, cheerfulness,
and hope, however, are the pervading tones of this work.&nbsp;
Whether the subject be the &lsquo;Newspaper People,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Spiritualism,&rsquo; &lsquo;London Gents.&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Criminal London,&rsquo; he has the happy disposition of
educing good and ennobling lessons and influence from each and
all.&mdash;<i>Press</i>.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
